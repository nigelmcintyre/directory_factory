Everything was really well done and the sauna felt amazing. Left feeling refreshed and chilled out. Highly recommend and will definitely be back! || amazing experience!! incredibly relaxing environment and super clean facilities as well. great decor too!

first time at a sauna and already ready to come back! || Beautiful sauna experience here! Always clean and friendly people working there. Location is amazing and lovely food court and pub just outside too || I had high expectations based on all the glowing reviews but unfortunately, my experience didn’t quite match the hype. Don’t get me wrong, the female staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, creating a great first impression and making you want to return. However, whoever is managing the overall operations needs to reassess the maximum capacity.

With nine people crammed into a hot sauna, it felt overcrowded and uncomfortable. Reducing the limit to seven would make a significant difference. The decor and rustic nature-inspired ambiance were well done, but the experience was dampened by the noise level. In the pod we chose, a group was talking loudly, laughing, and shouting which wasn’t the relaxing atmosphere I had hoped for, especially for my first sauna experience (in Ireland).

To make matters worse, when two people left for the plunge baths, seating naturally shifted due to the tight space. When they returned, one of them expected his original spot to still be available and tried to squeeze in, making another guest visibly uncomfortable to the point that she got up and left. His reaction was ‘I didn’t do anything’. 🚩🚩🚩🚩 This situation only highlighted the issue with the overcrowding in these pods.

My partner enjoyed it more once the crowd thinned out after this incident - but for me, it was enough to put me off returning. I did notice they offer Silent Nights and Ladies’ Nights, and I imagine a Silent Night would be a much better option for those seeking a peaceful experience. A safety factor that could be considered in the future are safety toggles, wrapped around the wrist when pressed it alerts the staff to check the pod out. ⚠️ something to ponder on of course. || Always a great experience here. Sauna is nice and hot, plunge is nice and cold. Friendly helpful staff. The barrel sauna has a high enough ceiling that the heat is pleasant. Stop for a coffee and a treat in Pan Eile in the courtyard when you are done. Rafa will look after you.",2026-02-14T09:42:48.674424

A lot of things being done properly here that aren't always done elsewhere in Irish saunas:
- properly hot saunas
- proper warm changing rooms
- Very clean everywhere
- Staff telling patrons to sit on towels and shower between saunas (basic but too many people won't do basic hygiene without being told to).
- properly cold plunge pools
- nice hot jacuzzis

Good value too. Keep up the good work! || Best sauna experience I’ve had in Ireland so far while visiting from Australia.
Option to have a silent or social sauna when booking. The views are amazing of the river and it’s actually cleaned between sessions which is something I haven’t seen much of in Ireland at other saunas.
The cold plunges and jacuzzi are great and the sauna is hot at around 95 degrees celcius. The staff are also welcoming and very clear on instructions when you adrive and tell people to shower after the sauna each time (something else I don’t see much of in Ireland)! Loved my session here.
Highly recommend and can’t wait to visit again. || Five stars doesn't do Treehouse Sauna justice.

Two saunas, two hot tubs, three cold plunges, two cold showers. It has everything you want. It is a little bit out of the way, but it's such great value at the same time.

One of the nicest saunas... actually the nicest sauna I've visited in Ireland. It's so clean, relaxing and aesthetically spot on. Can't recommend highly enough- i will keep on coming back 💯 || Absolutely phenomenal!
We had a magical hour this morning in The Treehouse. We were greeted by a wonderful  warm, friendly member of staff.  The envelopment of the river and surrounds was unreal. The design second to none.
10/10 for quality of sauna and pools. If I lived here I would definitely go on a regular basis. || Such a wonderful place to relax and recharge!
The sauna is always clean, cozy, and perfectly warm. The atmosphere is peaceful, and you can really feel the stress melting away.

A couple of tips: bring a towel to sit on in the sauna and there’s free parking on-site which is a big plus. Highly recommend for anyone looking to unwind and recharge. || 2nd sauna to review in Dublin!

Welcome to Fad Saoil, the sauna home of BMO running club! I was introduced to the sauna because I signed up for the run club’s long run series (and recovery thereafter) in preparation for the Dublin Marathon 2025.

So overall, Fad Saoil is pretty decent for a sauna place. They have 2 hot boxes (1 normal and 1 for silent sauna), 3 cold plunge tub with 3 different temperatures, shower area, changing rooms and a toilet. Fad Saoil can accommodate 16 pax per time slot.

I would say that it is a good value for money both for sauna members and non-members and they have packages for frequent visitors.

Staffs are so nice and accommodating but I won’t suggest to do walk-ins though as Fad Saoil gets busy too. Make sure you book online before visiting. 😂

Definitely visiting again!🙂 || Hands down the best sauna experience I’ve had in Dublin, I was introduced to the place by the BMO running club and have since became a regular both for recovery after runs and just to relax.

The staff is amazing and the vibe is so friendly and welcoming that it feels like someone’s living room. The location is ideal as well when it’s easy to get to (and also accessible to go for a run before your session).

I’m from Finland and grew up going to the sauna several times a week. Since moving to Dublin almost four years ago the thing I miss most has been a proper sauna - with the proper heat, cold plunge and atmosphere to go with it. So glad I finally found this place! || Small, but good setup & clean. 2 saunas on site & 3 cold plunges. This was my first time going there & it didn’t disappoint. There are numerous changing booths but no lockers for your belongings, only shelves to store them on. Would be great to see them get some lockers there for safe storage down the line. Picked up a sauna hat from them for 15 quid on the way out which I will be using on my next visit! || Cute little ""grotto"" tucked in the hustling and bustling of Rathmines.

The saunas are fantastic, they heat up very quick, especially the silent sauna, which you can essentially burn your ears off if you so choose to.

the plunge pool or plunge pods or whatever you want to call them are also really nice, although I wouldn't mind having a larger communal plunge so more people could join.

overall this is a great concept and honestly a fantastic setup that you can have great meetups or experiences with your friends and co-workers or whatever!

also if you can bring your own drinks so that's pretty cool.

I would absolutely go here again, and definitely recommend any of their locations.
apparently their greystones location has a scenery to die for, so I will be checking that out due to my great experience here!

thanks again!",2026-02-14T09:42:49.078707

Fair play, though — it works wonders!
The sauna? Always roasting — hotter than a Dublin bus in July, I swear. Sit in there for five minutes and you’ll be sweating out sins you didn’t even know you had.

Dan, the man himself — sound as a pound. Always up for a chat, keeps the place spotless, and makes everyone feel welcome.

The sauna was super slick (black in colour) which included essential oils to add to the hot stone. It was also spotless inside, with a footpath before entering.

Loved meeting and chatting with Roisin , she was so welcoming and friendly and even the people we met in the sauna were so friendly.

We booked the Wild Atlantic Sauna with Mags (25th October 2025) and it was honestly one of the highlights of our entire trip to Donegal. From the moment we arrived, Mags made everything feel so welcoming and personal – you can tell straight away that this isn’t just a business, it’s something she has poured real passion into.

The setting is breathtaking – a cosy barrel sauna tucked into the dunes, looking straight out onto miles of untouched beach, rolling waves, and the Donegal mountains in the distance. Sitting inside the wood-fired heat, watching the Atlantic through the panoramic window, felt like something out of a travel documentary.

The cold-water dip in the sea between sauna rounds was a total buzz – we had a mixture of seasoned dippers and first-timers in our group, and every single person came out beaming. The contrast between the freezing ocean and the crackling fire inside the sauna is addictive, and somehow you come out feeling lighter, calmer, and completely recharged.

What makes it even better is the little thoughtful touches – the relaxing scent of the timber, the bucket and ladle for löyly, the essential oils and Mags’ warm hospitality. Nothing felt rushed, nothing felt commercial – it felt like being hosted by a friend who knows and loves the area.

We had three generations with us – from swimmers in their 20s to a baby wrapped up in a carrier – and everyone got something out of it. It’s the kind of experience that stays with you long after you leave.

If you’re anywhere near Portnoo, Ardara, or Narin, book this. Don’t hesitate. It’s the purest way to experience the Wild Atlantic – sea, heat, salt air, and total switch-off time.

We’ll 100% be back – see your next time mags 😃 || Highly recommended, an incredible experience on the coast of the chilly Atlantic ocean, that offers a welcomed cold dip from the heat of the Finnish sauna with fantastic views of Dooey Beach. We had to visit twice over the course of our week’s holiday. If you are in this part of the world I can’t recommend the sauna enough. Mags the owner is so lovely and responsive, we’ll see you next time. || Gorgeous sauna with a stunning view of Dooey beach. We booked an hour slot in the sauna and had an amazing time. Mags was lovely and recommended a couple of coffee and food spots for afterwards. Will definitely return. || I’d been wanting to try a seaside sauna and this did not disappoint. Highlight of our trip to Dooey beach, would 100% do it again next time we’re there. The views were incredible, and the whole experience so relaxing. Loved trying the essential oils and Mags was so friendly and accommodating. Can’t recommend highly enough! || An absolute gem! Booked for an hour for my mum's 70th birthday and it was fantastic.
Mags is the best host, and the sauna is incredible. The view from the window is breathtaking, the temperature inside was nice and hot, and it's only a few yards to the sea when you need to cool off 🥶!  Mags provided lots of different essential oils, extra wood, and there were a couple of changing rooms so we could dry off out of the wind.
Will definitely be back again when we're in the area, it's unmissable!",2026-02-14T09:42:04.681476

The atmosphere is always calm and welcoming. The team are great, friendly, easygoing, and they clearly care about keeping the place clean and running well. It’s spotless every time.

What I really love is the people you meet. There’s something about sitting in a sauna, dripping sweat, that strips away pretense. Everyone’s just there to relax, unwind, and reset. It’s peaceful, grounding, and oddly social in the best way.

If you’re thinking about it - just go. You won’t regret it. || Such a lovely experience at the Boat Yard this evening. The facilities are top notch and the place is spotless.

Having recently spent a few weeks in Denmark and the Faroe Islands at a dozen saunas, this sauna was up there with the best saunas of Copenhagen. Only advice is, if coming from Kinsale, do not walk; take a car (or maybe bike).

We were only in Kinsale for 1 night and upon arrival, I stumbled across the sauna on google maps. I called the phone number and while no reply, had a response within 2 hours and we were accommodated at the last minute an hour later.

Cons - €15 and you are only allowed 45 minutes. Most allow you the full hour for that price. Maybe have a tap for drinking water also

Did not try the sauna. Service was excellent and coffee was delicious. The croissant was a ok, probably would try something different next time. Lovely location in a nice day! || 31st Finnish sauna review. These saunas are both great. Temperature was a minimum of 90c entire time, ranging up to 110c. Wood fired was 110c down to 90c, electric was a flat 105c. Humidity was 10% in both.

IMO the ash pan in the wood fired stove was kept open way too long and a bunch of the heat was being lost as the timber was being burnt through too often, leading to inconsistency.

Feedback to help with the culture; tell people when they attend to go in/out quickly and don’t keep the door open. Too many people didn’t seem to know about the importance of the door lot of good heat was lost.

The bucket and ladle in the electric sauna could/should be upgraded from plastic to wooden - hot plastics are bad.

The bench height in the electric sauna was perfect, law of löyly maintained. Also the first time seeing the rounded rocks in person. They do give off a smoother löyly, which is lovely. That combination has that experience being one of the most perfect saunas I’ve visited. With the rocks hot as they were the lämpömassa was on point, unlike others. This was a sauna I didn’t want to leave. The wood fired sauna’s temperature was variable based on how the fire was being fed, combined with the ash pan being open and it was a bit more hit and miss. Combined that with sitting a bit lower (law of löyly not observed) and it didn’t quite pack the same punch. Still a good experience, but not next level like the electric. The electric was the star of the show! Both heaters were Harvia heaters so quality.

The cold plunges were spot on, the coldest bath felt close to 0c and there was around 4-5 other baths with different temperatures.

Would love a warm shower to heat up afterwards before heading out, but that doesn’t take away from the experience. Will be back when next in Dublin. Thank you!",2026-02-14T09:42:48.761676

Some photos below ❤️🙂 || Best sauna in Greystones! Had the best experience and the facilities are fantastic. Loads of changing rooms, lockers to store your things, cold showers and 2 plunge pools that you can use throughout your visit. Feels very private and has a lovely relaxing vibe. Also in very close proximity to Burrito Box and Roots for a nice lunch or juice afterwards.

Would 100% recommend and will definitely be going back. Staff were lovely as well and were super understanding and accommodating when we were running a bit late for our session. || Great way to start a Sunday, easily the best sauna I've been to in Ireland so far. Was 90 degrees the first time we went in this morning and we were in the first slot of the day. Easy to have a dip across the road in Greystones harbour before hand too. Very clean and a great set up overall.

Will definitely be back! || Absolutely love the Barrel in Greystones. The botanical indoor outdoor feel makes for a cosy vibe no matter the weather. The facilities are the best around; the saunas are always hot and showers, barrels and temperature controlled cold baths mean you can curate your hot and cold therapy exactly as you want. Gorgeous incense burning helps to calm the mind. Always such a consistently nice visit to the Barrel and looking forward to the next one 🥰",2026-02-14T09:41:46.401564

And the cherry on top: every two hours they host different sauna rituals, which makes the experience even more special and immersive. We absolutely loved it. We’ve already been three times in January, brought friends along, even bought a gift voucher for my nephew — and we’re planning to get a membership for ourselves too.

Safe to say, we’re beyond happy with this place. Highly, highly recommended! || Great central location, pristine state of the art facilities and super friendly staff.

Cannot recommend highly enough. Keep up the good work lads || Had an amazing experience at Hot Box Sauna, Boland Mills. The sauna ritual with Otis was the highlight — expertly guided, calming, and incredibly restorative. Otis creates such a welcoming, focused atmosphere and clearly knows his craft.

The facilities are excellent: modern, spotless, and very well maintained, with cleanliness at a really high standard throughout.

Brilliant value for money for the quality of the experience. Highly recommend and will definitely be back 🔥🧖‍♀️ || An absolutely brilliant experience. Special mention to Otis and Maria. Maria’s aufguss ritual was exceptional, honestly worth the visit for that alone. The staff were all incredibly friendly and welcoming, the place is immaculately clean, and the atmosphere is calm and restorative. It felt like a real treat on a cold, rainy winter’s night.

Sauna was 100 degrees plus. Fabulous views over Roberts cove. The sea was clear and the beach clean. One of the best sauna experiences of my life. || 10/10 the best sauna experience I’ve had. The sauna was at a perfect temperature between 95-100 degrees. Robert’s Cove is a sand beach so no need to worry about walking on stones! Sara is an amazing host and even provides a skin scrub for your final dip! || Incredible sauna. Just had the loveliest swim/ sauna session. Sara is a 10/10 host. Head and body feeling great now. She also has a sugar scrub, skin feeling very soft || Swede Sauna is an amazing amenity located in Roberts Cove!
The facilities are perfect for anyone looking to experience hot and cold therapy!
I think it is an ideal way to enjoy swimming in cold open water during the winter months and as soon as we tried the Sauna once we are hooked!

The owner Sara is very friendly. She is really enthusiastic about her business and keeps her Sauna spotlessly clean!
She is always looking into new ways to help make the session a more immersive experience for her customers!
Some of the things Sara does is that she adds essential oils to the water bucket inside the sauna. Then as you pour this water over the hot rocks the steam is infused with the oils.
She also holds birching Sauna sessions, Yoga Sauna sessions and full moon Sauna sessions!

The Sauna:
It is a traditional wood framed Sauna which uses a wood burning stove to produce the heat. The stove is fuelled from the exterior while the body of the stove and chimney is on the inside. There are rocks surrounding the body of the stove and are constantly being heated.
There is a bucket of water beside the stove with a ladle and this can be used to pour water over the rocks to create steam!
There is a hygrometer and a thermometer allowing the customer to monitor conditions within the Sauna. There is also a sand timer in the Sauna rated in 5 minute increments and a maximum of 15 minutes. This ideal to track your session and wearing an electronic watch or metal watch is not ideal in the hot and humid environment of the Sauna!

Benefits for me:
I'm not going to claim all the benefits that some people say that Saunas and cold water swimming can aid to however, I do feel amazing after a session and Sara's Sauna is in the perfect location for me.
I love immersing myself in the cold water for a few minutes and then going for about a 15 minute sweat and then back into the water. Each time that we have went so far we have gone for an hour and we aim to get 4 to 5 dips with each session.
The amount of swims or how long you want to spend in the Sauna is all up to you and I find the sand timer great for this!

Cost:
I think the Sauna is very reasonable at €10 for half an hour or €20 for a full hour. This is for an open session where you and others can come and go as you or they please.
There is the option of booking a private session for €85 for an hour. This is also reasonable in my opinion as if you can split it with 5 or more friends it works out cheaper than an open session!

Tips:
I would look at the tide times so that you can avail of the high tide and don't have to walk to far from the Sauna to get to the water.
Opening times change everyday as I believe Sara follows the high tide so it could be a morning session or an evening session that she is open for.
Bring 2 towels as you will need a fresh towel to dry off afterwards and I recommend to sit on a different one so that you keep it clean/hygenic for other Sauna users!

Overall opinion:
I think that the experienct you get at Swede Sauna is brilliant! Sara is very friendly and the location can't be beaten!
I highly recommend giving it a try, you won't be disappointed! || Have visited Swede Sauna 3 times in the last couple of months with family and friends. Visited at the weekend and  2 out of the 3 times Sara had overbooked the sauna so wasnt as enjoyable experience as other saunas I tried around Cork. Online booking says it holds 8 people but Sara has over booked it to be 12 people. Its too much of a tight squeeze and then youre coordinating with other between re who is in the sauna vs in the sea. The first time it happened Sara said it was an accident that it was overbooked by mistake but then it happened a second time I visited so I think its something that happens regularly. Such a shame as its a gorgeous location, just not very relaxing when youre packed in with too many people. Won't be back unfortunately.",2026-02-14T09:42:23.249226

The area has a rustic and spartan style - the parking is located behind some containers - but this adds to the authentic charm of the place. Don't expect luxury, but everything you need is there: electricity and water are available, and the restrooms, though chemical toilets, are functional.

What makes this place special are the extra services: the possibility to use the sauna and take seaweed baths is a real plus, along with the small bar where you can relax. The surrounding panorama is truly splendid and worth the visit alone.

The value for money is excellent: 25 euros per night is really affordable considering the prices of other campsites in the area. For those looking for an authentic experience, essential services, and great scenery without breaking the bank, this place is perfect.

The lake is very refreshing for a dip.

Review edit July2025: the experience you get really depends on who is working, I went last week at 7pm and when I got in the fire was out and I had to ask the person working to relight it. 20 minutes of the 1 hour session spent heating the sauna up from scratch.

There just something about the Sauna Snug that works I'm sure when you go down and try it you'll know what I mean.
I've been to other Sauna places where you can feel how wellness and saunas are being used in Ireland to replace traditional social settings, you can feel how they're set up to make money, and you feel rushed.

The sea sauna set-up itself is great- a really clever use of what is a small space, looking forward to seeing it expanded in the future!

Robin, the staff member on-site was fantastic, super knowledgeable, approachable and friendly which was great for us as non-regular sauna users! She was really on-top of keeping the saunas, plunge barrels and showers clean and at the right temps!

The box sauna itself was really enjoyable, clean, spacious and at a consistent temp. The view is the best I’ve seen from a Dublin sauna! The showers and plunge barrels are well located, and although they can be busy we didn’t ever have to queue for more than 2 minutes for either.

It really is a little oasis and they have set it up wonderfully, and it looks great in every aspect BUT they need to work on the temperatures of their sauna's. The two wood fired saunas were over 120 degrees when i went in, and you could barely breathe. So then I tried the electric ones, and one was only 40 degrees, and the other was a perfect 80 degrees but when I tried to sit down the wood was so hot it burnt me. I dont know why, I think they may have used the wrong wood in this sauna? Because ive never experienced that before, and ive been to a lot of saunas. I even tried with my towel, but wherever I touched the wood it was like seriously burning so I couldn't relax. I told the staff but they didnt seem to care, and just offered me a towel. Which made me wonder why I'd been using my towel and hadn't been offered one from the start if they had towels for customers.
I ended up going back to the wood fired one, leaving the door open till the temperature came back down below 100 and this was quite nice, but overall not the relaxing experience you want from a sauna.
The place looks fantastic and the ice baths are an awesome touch, and by all accounts the place should have been packed, yet there were maybe 2 other people here, which begs the question why?
Also in the whole hour or longer I was in the sauna (which started out at over 120 degrees) the staff did not check or do a single round to see if people were ok? There were two of them just sitting there chatting and I think maybe their time would have been spent better checking on the saunas and ensuring the temperatures were kept within a certain range.
The idea is great, the place itself is great and you've almost got an amazing experience, but temperature is so important in a sauna, and you need to work on yours a bit. If you fix that, you'll have a wonderful place ✨️
Also do not like the plastic water bottles. If you're going to operate a sauna a water bottle refill station is a non negotiable! || So pleased to have this gem of a spot so local to us. Impressive set-up of an array of wood-fired and electric sauna options, different temp. cold plunges and crucially proper shower facilities for after. 10/10.

Nothing compares to stepping out into the Atlantic afterwards. While the ocean may not be as icy as some cold plunges depending on the season, its definitely cold enough and the combination of salt water and the benefit of grounding more than makes up for it.

They have two saunas - one is a good bit hotter than the other. So you have options to choose from. This can lead to the hotter one being fuller though.

The river being used as the cold plunge is excellent and obviously will never get full - this is a highlight and adds to the uniqueness of this place

Toilets have been added at the back - this is a welcomed addition.

The shared changing rooms are on the smaller side and fill up rather quickly - staggered welcome times might assist with this.

A hot tub was roasting and really enjoyable - a proper treat after the cold plunge on a winters day

They have plenty of seating around a fire pit, cold showers and drop buckets also

A great sauna that I’ll visit again || This is a genuine review.

Really nice setup - cold shower, buckets, swimming area, and a lovely Finnish style sauna 🔥 The only things that let it down is that the toilet is located about 100m away, is locked, and a member of staff has to take you there. The parking situation isn’t great either as there isn’t enough of it, and the carpark is very muddy. However the sauna itself is top notch 👌

Edit: 30/09 after my second visit. Great value at €15 for an hour, and the recent addition of the wood fired hot tub is very nice! The sauna is also very clean. I'd give 4.5 stars if I could - all that's missing is a toilet, because you know, nature calls.

Edit: 23/12, Really nice experience visiting after dark when it's all lit up ✨️ and the fire is going 🔥 Plenty of parking now too, albeit a bit muddy at this time of year. || I had an amazing experience at the sauna sessions nestled deep in the forest.

The natural surroundings create the perfect atmosphere for relaxation and mindfulness. The sauna itself was cozy, clean, and beautifully designed to blend with nature. The staff are amazing. || A True Return to Nature
I’ve tried many saunas, but nothing compares to the Sauna Sessions at Stradbally experience. The commitment to sustainability isn't just a marketing gimmick—it’s woven into the entire design. Being out in the fresh air, surrounded by the peaceful Stradbally countryside, instantly drops your stress levels before you even step inside.

Also, no way to reach the business. I sent multiple emails to ask about lost items left with no response to date.

To our horror we realised that there is a large cavity between the floor and wall (see pictures below) - a huge health & safety risk. The cavity was around 5cm wide in parts so we flashed a light and were unable to see the earbud. I spoke to Amy at the reception who said that she would look with a rubbish picker and offered nothing else. She also explained that this happened already with a customer who dropped their keys but “the guys” were able to get them. I stated my concern for the health & safety cavity in the floor directly under the ladies changing benches to which she said “we’re not open that long and we’ve already fixed the roof and that it’s up to the guy who owns the building not the enterprise renting?” I replied that I didn’t think it was good enough, she  offered no compensation or apology.  A half an hour later she found us in the sauna while she was adding blocks to the fire, and said she tried but couldn’t see anything and “taking the floor boards up would be tricky” I asked if that was an option she said no. . So I asked for a pair of gloves to search myself her response was her arms/ hands were too lanky but someone like my with smaller hands would be better for the job”, her solution was that we could stay in the sauna a bit longer? Allowing a customer to even go near the cavity filled with sharp nails, dirty socks is a health violation in itself. We entered the changing room about 10 mins later, & we saw Amy had left the picker there for us to use to no avail.  I had to then with my friends assistance to lay on the floor searching with a plastic bag over my hand, I wasn’t able to search for long due to the rusty nails sticking outwards. We decided is wasn’t worth searching for given the dirt. My friend had hung her coat and bottoms on opposite coat hangers, which were soaked right through - so the roof repair clearly wasn’t up to par. As we left, I asked Amy to process a refund for today, her face squirmed in disbelief. I said it’s a health & safety risk, you’ve not offered up any compensation, and showed her the coat that was completely soaked through on the hook (see in picture). Her response was sharp, “that’s what the lockers are there for when it’s raining” I said you don’t have a sign up stating that you have a leaky roof under both the areas where my friend hung her clothes? Same with the floor there should be a sign to be careful for the gap. She reminded us that they aren’t open that long, to which I said the hot box group have been running for a long time & we’ve been loyal customers and secondly, this issue has happened in the past so why haven’t they sorted the cavity from a health and safety point of view. I asked for her name & asked her to confirm that she didn’t think my refund request was fair due to the shock on her face. She said she’d be happy for me to add all of my concerns into a Google review instead. || Everything was perfect, staff is delightful and the place is stunning! I am leaving 4 stars only because there is no toilet available but: will definitely be back :D lovely. || 43rd Finnish sauna review: location is simply stunning. 2 wood fired sauna on the Irish coast. Each sauna was around 98c. 2 level of benches. Harvia stoves. The stove is well sized for the sauna, allowing 8 or so people per sauna. The löyly is soft, but based on the small sauna size doesn’t mess around either. The ladle was unique; allowing a good scoop of water but allowed  gradual stream into the rocks, helping with the soft feeling. The team kept the stove well fed throughout the session. Very short walk to the ocean. Great location, great experience. || The Hot Box Sauna in Killiney is an absolute must when visiting the area. It’s a truly unique and refreshing experience. The setting is spectacular, with panoramic views of the coastline that make it feel extra special. The sauna itself is beautifully maintained, and the option to cool off with a sea swim or outdoor shower is invigorating. A special shout out to Amy and Otis, whose warm hospitality make the experience even more enjoyable. They are attentive, welcoming, and clearly passionate about ensuring everyone has a memorable visit. Highly recommended! || We visited for the first time this week. It was so great. From the moment we arrived Otis was a great host, made us feel very welcome. The location is perfect, the ocean crashing outside the large sauna window helps to draw you into a state of relaxation and reflection. We will definitely be back.

Nice staff
Nice view
Easy access from city for a short day trip.

Not so good:
Heat is definitely not as hot as others i have used. However this may be part of it's unique style as a caravan vs purpose built sauna barrel etc.
Little on the expensive side for what it is.

So for newbies to sauna I would recommend but anyone looking for intense heat, try elsewhere. Nice visit for tourist to pass a few hours from city centre. || Wonderful little sauna i found the tempeture really good  even bwttee was the lovely lad who was full of knowledge and very welcoming...it seems people would rather complain about bottled water  than there experience     it aint state of the art but perfectl location right on the sea..absolute  pleasure   i suppose u cant please the public. Dnt let one or two bad remarks  put u off having a nice experience. try it for yoursel..the  competiors envy is real.. || Similar thoughts to another reviewer.
This feels like an absolute cash-grab. 20€ for an hour is well too expensive for what you get.

Major problems are:
1. The sauna itself:
- It is not well insulated.
- The door doesn't shut properly so there is a
cold draft coming in constantly.
- Single glazed window saps the heat out of the
sauna.
- Lack of cleanliness from the floor and the
boards you sit on.
- No thermometer.
- No double door/porch area so when someone
leaves the sauna all the heat is sucked out.
- Most saunas you can last max 15
minutes but here I spent the whole 1 hour
session in the sauna without needing a break.
It felt like a warm room with cold drafts rather
than a sauna.
2. Amenities:
- no showers,
- no toilets or sinks
- no lockers
- no changing rooms
- no taps to refill water
- no plunge pool. There is the sea which is
great but for 20 euro there should at least be
an in-house shower

Positives: small coffee shop in there and staff are nice.

Would not return. || This review is about sustainability only! ☺️

I was disappointed to see the sale of plastic bottled water on the premises. Especially a mere stone’s throw from the beach.

By 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Over 95% of the plastic that we create, use, and even intentionally recycle, does not actually get recycled. Instead, it ends up in landfills, incinerators, and in our waters. It then breaks down into micro plastics, which are having a profoundly negative effect on human health, let alone other species.

The ancient global (and local) tradition of sauna and sweat lodge has no place for plastics. In fact, it feels antithetical to the practice at large.

I wonder if instead you could at least sell aluminum, canned water, as aluminum can be infinitely recycled. But selling plastics to those who have come to enjoy a very place that is being degraded by plastics, feels misguided.

Thank you for considering how to run this sauna more sustainably. I had a wonderful time here, and the service was friendly. But surely there is a way to better align sauna philosophy and wisdom with sustainability efforts. Our earth can’t wait. || 5 stars to this amazing located Sauna. Friendly and helpful staff and literally just in front of Sandycove Beach and just a minute's walk from Forty Foot. Definitely, the installation can be renewed with time and move stuff around so the Sauna window could actually point out to the beach instead of the coffee shop. (Just a suggestion) The place has so much potential and I wish them the best of luck with its service.",2026-02-14T09:42:01.097632

This place does not value its regular customers and it seems as though they’re trying to make as much money out of people. No toilet facilities within the barn facility itself. You hydrate and drink water when you’re in the sauna and have to go into the gym next door to go to the toilet. Now they’ve put in an extra sauna but haven’t put in basic facilities. Talk about cramming people into a small space to generate more revenue.

I tried to use the shower after in the gym. Was told by one staff member I could and when I came in after using sauna and cold plunge pool, a staff member blocked my way and stood infront of me and told me I couldn’t. Despite the fact I was told I could before, he persisted in saying I couldn’t.

It’s clear they’ve no loyalties towards their regular customers and it’s just about making as much money out of people. What a shame. || Tried to book 4 sessions with my girlfriend, I couldn’t find a way to pay or see if it was pay on arrival, or get in contact with the pages.

Got charged €60 for 4 sessions that I had cancelled.

I booked and cancelled within an hour and There was no information regarding cancellation periods.

Booking system is ridiculous and  should really be reimbursed for that.

Have seen quite a few comments regarding booking sysmtem being iffy too. ||  || ",2026-02-14T09:42:12.222586
