Robin, the staff member on-site was fantastic, super knowledgeable, approachable and friendly which was great for us as non-regular sauna users! She was really on-top of keeping the saunas, plunge barrels and showers clean and at the right temps!

The box sauna itself was really enjoyable, clean, spacious and at a consistent temp. The view is the best I’ve seen from a Dublin sauna! The showers and plunge barrels are well located, and although they can be busy we didn’t ever have to queue for more than 2 minutes for either.

The beach is a 3/4 minute walk away and is a lovely swim spot. There are a good few steps down and *lots* of seaweed on the shoreline but still, a fantastic place to go in between sauna sessions!

The atmosphere is always calm and welcoming. The team are great, friendly, easygoing, and they clearly care about keeping the place clean and running well. It’s spotless every time.

What I really love is the people you meet. There’s something about sitting in a sauna, dripping sweat, that strips away pretense. Everyone’s just there to relax, unwind, and reset. It’s peaceful, grounding, and oddly social in the best way.

They were very apologetic, refunded us, and gave us 2 passes to use in the future. I was very pleased with this! I will definitely be coming back and I recommend 100%! || Hands down the best Barrell Sauna spot around. Amazing atmosphere, and feel to it with incense burning, gorgeous greenery all around.

Extremely clean, snacks, and the owner is incredibly kind and accommodating- always trying to create best experience for you and he has a great attention to detail

Some photos below ❤️🙂 || Best sauna in Greystones! Had the best experience and the facilities are fantastic. Loads of changing rooms, lockers to store your things, cold showers and 2 plunge pools that you can use throughout your visit. Feels very private and has a lovely relaxing vibe. Also in very close proximity to Burrito Box and Roots for a nice lunch or juice afterwards.

Would 100% recommend and will definitely be going back. Staff were lovely as well and were super understanding and accommodating when we were running a bit late for our session. || Great way to start a Sunday, easily the best sauna I've been to in Ireland so far. Was 90 degrees the first time we went in this morning and we were in the first slot of the day. Easy to have a dip across the road in Greystones harbour before hand too. Very clean and a great set up overall.

Will definitely be back! || Absolutely love the Barrel in Greystones. The botanical indoor outdoor feel makes for a cosy vibe no matter the weather. The facilities are the best around; the saunas are always hot and showers, barrels and temperature controlled cold baths mean you can curate your hot and cold therapy exactly as you want. Gorgeous incense burning helps to calm the mind. Always such a consistently nice visit to the Barrel and looking forward to the next one 🥰"

They have two saunas - one is a good bit hotter than the other. So you have options to choose from. This can lead to the hotter one being fuller though.

The river being used as the cold plunge is excellent and obviously will never get full - this is a highlight and adds to the uniqueness of this place

Toilets have been added at the back - this is a welcomed addition.

The shared changing rooms are on the smaller side and fill up rather quickly - staggered welcome times might assist with this.

A hot tub was roasting and really enjoyable - a proper treat after the cold plunge on a winters day

They have plenty of seating around a fire pit, cold showers and drop buckets also

A great sauna that I’ll visit again || This is a genuine review.

Really nice setup - cold shower, buckets, swimming area, and a lovely Finnish style sauna 🔥 The only things that let it down is that the toilet is located about 100m away, is locked, and a member of staff has to take you there. The parking situation isn’t great either as there isn’t enough of it, and the carpark is very muddy. However the sauna itself is top notch 👌

Edit: 30/09 after my second visit. Great value at €15 for an hour, and the recent addition of the wood fired hot tub is very nice! The sauna is also very clean. I'd give 4.5 stars if I could - all that's missing is a toilet, because you know, nature calls.

Edit: 23/12, Really nice experience visiting after dark when it's all lit up ✨️ and the fire is going 🔥 Plenty of parking now too, albeit a bit muddy at this time of year. || I had an amazing experience at the sauna sessions nestled deep in the forest. The place is incredibly peaceful and quiet  the only sounds come from the gentle rustling of the trees and the nearby waterfall. The natural surroundings create the perfect atmosphere for relaxation and mindfulness. The sauna itself was cozy, clean, and beautifully designed to blend with nature. The staff are amazing. || A True Return to Nature
I’ve tried many saunas, but nothing compares to the Sauna Sessions at Stradbally experience. The commitment to sustainability isn't just a marketing gimmick—it’s woven into the entire design. Being out in the fresh air, surrounded by the peaceful Stradbally countryside, instantly drops your stress levels before you even step inside. The heat is deep, clean, and perfectly managed by the sauna experts. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Marius for his professionalism and genuine care for the guests. His dedication to making sure we are well taken care of truly makes a difference. You can tell this isn't just a barrel plopped down; this is a meticulously designed space for healing and relaxation. For anyone who cherishes nature and wants a truly conscious wellness experience, this is the only place to go. I felt renewed, recharged, and immediately booked my next session. You will absolutely keep coming back after your first try. || One of the best sauna experiences I've had. The setting is just incredible and the views from the sauna and the hot tub just spectacular. The layout and the whole feel of the place is very special.  I'll definitely be going back 🙏"

Nice staff
Nice view
Easy access from city for a short day trip.

Not so good:
Heat is definitely not as hot as others i have used. However this may be part of it's unique style as a caravan vs purpose built sauna barrel etc.
Little on the expensive side for what it is.

So for newbies to sauna I would recommend but anyone looking for intense heat, try elsewhere. Nice visit for tourist to pass a few hours from city centre. || Wonderful little sauna i found the tempeture really good  even bwttee was the lovely lad who was full of knowledge and very welcoming...it seems people would rather complain about bottled water  than there experience     it aint state of the art but perfectl location right on the sea..absolute  pleasure   i suppose u cant please the public. Dnt let one or two bad remarks  put u off having a nice experience. try it for yoursel..the  competiors envy is real.. || Similar thoughts to another reviewer.
This feels like an absolute cash-grab. 20€ for an hour is well too expensive for what you get.

Major problems are:
1. The sauna itself:
- It is not well insulated.
- The door doesn't shut properly so there is a
cold draft coming in constantly.
- Single glazed window saps the heat out of the
sauna.
- Lack of cleanliness from the floor and the
boards you sit on.
- No thermometer.
- No double door/porch area so when someone
leaves the sauna all the heat is sucked out.
- Most saunas you can last max 15
minutes but here I spent the whole 1 hour
session in the sauna without needing a break.
It felt like a warm room with cold drafts rather
than a sauna.
2. Amenities:
- no showers,
- no toilets or sinks
- no lockers
- no changing rooms
- no taps to refill water
- no plunge pool. There is the sea which is
great but for 20 euro there should at least be
an in-house shower

Positives: small coffee shop in there and staff are nice.

Would not return. || This review is about sustainability only! ☺️

I was disappointed to see the sale of plastic bottled water on the premises. Especially a mere stone’s throw from the beach.

By 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Over 95% of the plastic that we create, use, and even intentionally recycle, does not actually get recycled. Instead, it ends up in landfills, incinerators, and in our waters. It then breaks down into micro plastics, which are having a profoundly negative effect on human health, let alone other species.

The ancient global (and local) tradition of sauna and sweat lodge has no place for plastics. In fact, it feels antithetical to the practice at large.

I wonder if instead you could at least sell aluminum, canned water, as aluminum can be infinitely recycled. But selling plastics to those who have come to enjoy a very place that is being degraded by plastics, feels misguided.

Thank you for considering how to run this sauna more sustainably. I had a wonderful time here, and the service was friendly. But surely there is a way to better align sauna philosophy and wisdom with sustainability efforts. Our earth can’t wait. || 5 stars to this amazing located Sauna. Friendly and helpful staff and literally just in front of Sandycove Beach and just a minute's walk from Forty Foot. Definitely, the installation can be renewed with time and move stuff around so the Sauna window could actually point out to the beach instead of the coffee shop. (Just a suggestion) The place has so much potential and I wish them the best of luck with its service."

Fantastic set-up on one of the best beaches on the North Coast.  Sander is such a welcoming host.  The sheltered changing area is brilliant for a bit of extra privacy / shelter from the elements.

This is my favourite sauna layout&I've been in a fair few!  The L-shaped bench is great for chatting with friends / family while you sauna and enjoy the views out of the huge window!

The deck chairs are a great idea for folk to relax and cool off on if you don't want the cold water contrast.

A sauna is my favourite way of catching up with friends and the social saunas are great for meeting new folk.  Delighted with the extended opening hours over the Xmas period.

Get yourself booked in! || I joined a social sauna on a cool summer Friday morning  and I can't say enough amazing things about it. It was a lovely time with four others. I enjoyed every second of the experience. Sander, the man in charge was friendly and helpful. Would do again. Thank you! || We had a fantastic time on 3rd Jan 26. Outside it was very cold, hailing and windy which made the in between swims all the more exhilarating.  Brilliant day for the family.

Our recent stay at Farnham Estate was nothing short of magical, and it will forever hold a very special place in our hearts. During our visit, my partner had planned a surprise engagement that staff were in on and made happen, we got engaged down by the lake just the two of us. It was a beautiful walk down and the lake itself was breathtaking.

From the moment we arrived back, the staff went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable. Every single person we encountered was warm, attentive and genuinely delighted to be part of our celebration. The level of care and thoughtfulness we received was exceptional.

The special treatment we were given made us feel so valued and celebrated, with little touches of glasses of champagne throughout the day,  that showed just how much pride the team takes in creating memorable experiences for their guests. Nothing was too much trouble, even when we had to make a last minute adjustment to our dinner time. We even got a tour of the grounds on how weddings are planned in Farnham, kindly organised by Danielle and given by the hotel manager Colm. They really were able to paint a picture on how magical our wedding day would look.

We cannot recommend Farnham highly enough and will cherish our engagement there forever. We are already looking forward to returning to relive the magic all over again hopefully on our wedding day. || We stayed here for my wife's birthday and I must say it was an amazing experience all the staff were lovely and they made a great effort for her birthday. We had dinner in both restaurants and the food was amazing.
The hole experience was really relaxing and lovely.
Just one thing they could fix is the pool temperature was just bit too cold and some of the showers in the steam room didn't work. || Spent 2 nights here and loved it. The only thing I would suggest is the cellar bar is quite small to host live music and you have to be lucky to get a table where the music is being played (which we did on our 2nd night) maybe there is something to be done in the future to expand it?
The food, the pool, the forest walk and the staff were all lovely. Will definitely look to return at some stage. || I returned to Farnham Estate with my mother during the week. We had a really enjoyable stay at this hotel. The staff were warm and welcoming from the moment we arrived. Our room was clean, comfortable, and with everything we needed for a pleasant visit.

Dinner and breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice, and the service was consistently friendly. The presentation of our dinner in the Cedar Rooms was notably beautiful.

There was a small hiccup during our stay when the boiler had an issue, which meant the water was cold for a while. I understand these things happen. The outdoor pool was also closed on the evening which we used the thermal suite facilities. This was rectified on the morning in which we checked out.

Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and would happily stay again. The hotel has a lot of charm, great service, and a welcoming feel that makes it easy to recommend. || I was really disappointed with our recent stay at this hotel having stayed there 16 years ago and been really impressed. Unfortunately the service has really declined. Very long wait times at the bar for a drink and some simple fixes for this that are not being optimised like young untrained staff who were having to hop up on counter tops to reach for bottles at the top of cabinets and/or being unable to slide open the bar display door. It's also not kept clean. We noticed at lunch time chips had been dropped on the floor and went back to the bar 5 hours later and they were still there but had been mashed into the floor due to being walked on repeatedly by staff and guests.

We waited 50mins for our dinner in the bar (having only ordered burgers). Staff apologized after realizing our dinner order was forgotten but only after we highlighted this but then took a further 15 minutes to receive food. Most of the staff are young school going teenagers.

Dinner in Maxwell's did not reflect the price point. We received our starters before our wine then I found a hair in my steak and when returned to me was reheated and burnt to a crisp and I had lost my appetite at this point too.

Breakfast is plentiful and breakfast staff are pleasant however I ordered poached egg from the menu the second morning and this took 40mins to come and when it did was more like two boiled eggs, completely hard.

The grounds are beautiful, the bed is extremely comfortable and the complimentary water is a nice bonus. However I could not recommend a stay based on how it's currently run, which is such a shame."

Our dinner was a highlight of the entire trip. The starter, a beautifully presented salad topped with perfectly crisp lamb croquettes, was fresh, flavourful, and plated with real attention to detail. The main course was just as impressive: a perfectly cooked fillet of seabass. Every bite was balanced and delicious. And dessert was the perfect finale.

The dining experience alone is worth staying here for. Combined with the elegant rooms and excellent amenities. Highly recommended — we can’t wait to come back! || Fantastic 2 days, food was delicious. Staff were amazing. The South African girl in the Summit restaurant (didn’t catch her name) she was so attentive and lovely with the kids. The breakfast staff were also lovely. Kudos to the night porter who was unbelievably helpful when my son became unwell I would like to thank him but again didn’t get his name he was working on the night of the 25th and really couldn’t do enough for us. Room 204 was fabulous for a family of 5. Very spacious. Leisure centre was clean and warm. The spa is unbelievable ! Thermal suite was closed for maintenance but we honestly didn’t need it as we were relaxed enough after wonderful massages. We will definitely be back. Please thank the night porter from me I would have loved to see him before we left to thank him myself. || I booked the Slieve as a present for my partner and paid extra for use of the spa. The “foot spa” was more like a sink and you controlled the temperate yourself (in comparison to other spas that have foot spas which generally have jets and the water fills up itself and drains). The salt room also didn’t work. The tropical shower was supposed to light up but they were not working and one of the buttons didn’t work. The lift to our room was not accessible on x2 occasions as when we tried to get to our room as staff left large laundry trolleys inside them leaving no room for us to stand inside. When we did get to our room for the first time after check in, there were empty alcohol bottles and glasses lying outside the door. I sent an email as general feedback, stating areas of concern as stated above and areas that were great, such as the summit restaurant aswell as the bar. The hotel manager stated their apologies and said if I paid for another room and return to the Slieve, they’d offer the spa for free. It’s worth noting the price offered for a second stay was actually more than what I originally paid. I had said I was not keen to pay a large sum of money yet again to stay, just to get free access to the spa which was disappointing regardless. I asked kindly if, since they were going to offer free use of the spa on another occasion, they could instead refund us the cost of the spa given a lot of the facilities weren’t working. They declined this and said their “offer of goodwill” was the only option as a refund for the spa was “not appropriate”. I genuinely would have considered returning to the Slieve with the intentions of giving a second chance incase of just getting them on a bad day - like I said, my initial email was sent for feedback purposes. However the way management handled this situation has entirely put us off. Therefore we will no longer be returning and definitely will not be recommending it to anyone. || My partner surprised me with 2 nights stay here for engagement and it was just fantastic!

I have been to Cabu by the Lakes twice, and each stay felt absolutely magical. It’s one of those rare places that instantly makes you feel calm and inspired — surrounded by nature, beautiful design, and pure comfort. The cabins are stylish yet so cozy, every detail perfectly thought out to make you feel at home.

I especially loved the Japanese bath — such a peaceful, unforgettable experience — and the charming Cabu Corner Shop, where every visit feels like a treat.

I truly miss this place and wish to return one day. It will always remain one of my top favorite escapes in the world. 🌿✨ || We had an absolutely brilliant stay at Cabu this week. It far exceeded our expectations. The staff are all so friendly and helpful. Special shout out to Calvin who took us on a 2 hour kayaking trip! The cabin itself was gorgeous - it had everything we needed and was so comfy and cosy. We did the Japanese forest bathing which was a fantastic experience, kayaking, bike riding through the forest and the sauna and hot tub. We only wish we could have stayed longer and we're already planning our next trip! What a beautiful place! || Great place to get some peace and quiet time. Love the cabins, kitchen is really well equipped, beds are super comfy, it's very clean and cosy. Recommend doing kayaking."

He told us that the bar accepted walk in customers and that the bar was not at all busy on Fri evening. Alas, the opposite was true and the bar was packed. We were catered for in a function room. The poor man also needs to be updated on breakfast times as his current time of 7am to 10am is incorrect.
The indoor pool was quite cold considering the time of year too. It also took a while for the rooms heating to come on given the cold spell that we are currently experiencing. Finally there appeared to be no noise policy in operation as I was awoken three times by very loud guests at various hours of the early morning.

On the plus side the room was very spacious for a family of four and the bathroom facilities were top notch. The staff member who served us our food was very friendly, chatty and overall very nice. He definitely deserves a raise!! || I recently stayed at the hotel and here are my thoughts:

The Negatives:
- The bar area was absolutely filthy, it was busy yes, but I was sat down at a table that despite being wiped down still had chairs covered in crumbs etc, fair enough, easily wiped off.
- There was a fire alarm set off at around 9pm/9:30pm, the hotel did have a notification up in the lobby that there would be a test on Monday at 12:30pm but to ignore other ones (fair enough): I did mention this the following morning and was basically told that a guest had set it off, there was nothing they could do etc. A basic apology would have been a nice start. Understand guests can, and will, do stupid things, but at least apologize for the disturbance.
- Kids & Teens run rampant through the halls as late as 10:30-11pm. Staff can't really do much other than request them not to do this I guess? Despite the noise etc.

The Positive:
- Bar staff very helpful and polite despite being under pressure.
- Food in the bar is absolutely fantastic.
- The hotel is very close to the nearby shopping centre.
- The hotel room (family one) was extremely spacious, with a decent sized fridge for storage.
- The breakfast buffet is very, very good.
- The swimming pool was lovely to use and the gym facilities are definitely better than the offerings from hotels I previously stayed at.
- Plenty of amenities for kids and a good selection of events on offer for the future.

All in all, more positive than negative, but the negative is something to be mindful of. I would still recommend a stay here. || We had our wedding at the Hillgrove Hotel on 12th September. What can I say in relation, there isn't enough positive adjectives in the dictionary for me to show our appreciation to all the staff at the Hillgrove. The made our special day all the more memorable.

We stayed the night before the wedding day and what I can say is from this point until the moment we checked out, everyone who attended and stayed were treated exceptionally by staff.

Special thanks to Dean Coyne (Wedding Coordinator) for making our day turn out the best it possibly could. From the moment we booked up until the day he made everything so easy, with packages including a variety of suppliers he trusted, who all turned out to be incredible. A massive thank you Dean.

If you're currently planning your wedding day, I would 100% recommend giving Dean and the Hillgrove a visit! || I just returned from a night away in the Hillgrove with my son , I decided to treat him before school starts next week as he loves the pool. Well it didn’t disappoint, as soon as we checked in my son was given a goody bag with treats and information on the kids club. We loved the pool, it was big and clean. Our room was very spacious and spotless and even though there was a wedding there was no noise at night. Food very nice, pleasant helpful staff. I didn’t get to try the spa this time but it’s my plan for the next visit. || Two night stay was very relaxing...food in bar and breakfast was delicious. Staff very attentive and helpful."

About the size of a hotel room. The Bluetooth speaker was a nice touch.

The restaurant is a big let down, portions are tiny and after spending £100 on food I left hungry.

The breakfast bap was okay but again it won't fill you. It's delivered to your cabin gate in a wood box.

The sauna is free from 8.30am to 10.30am which is great but when I went down at 8.30am it was stone cold. It didn't warm up until about 09.10am so was useless. It's a lovely sauna with views out over a lake but needs to be turned on about 45 minutes before opening.

All the staff were really nice and helpful at all times.

Overall it's not good value for money. It's a very expensive place which should be five star standard for the price but falls short. I'm being generous given it a four star review. || We received a gift voucher and chose to stay in the premium dome — an experience that had been on our list for a long time and it absolutely lived up to expectations. The dome was very private, warm and cozy with a super comfortable bed, a great shower and plenty of thoughtful little touches that made the stay feel special.

We ate in the restaurant, Lasair, which was delicious. Each dish was bursting with flavours and the staff were genuinely lovely, so easygoing and welcoming..

The whole setting was quiet and peaceful, perfect for slowing down and unwinding.
We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would happily return. || We loved it; went for one night to premium bubble dome. Its very relaxing;  Domes are very comfortable; Views are stunning. Very clean' . It was like sleeping outside.  We had a cloudy sky , only a few starts but was still amazing. Toilet area a bit small . Nice mini bar drinks. Food in restaurant was gorgeous. We went for vegan tapas menu. Every morsel was lovely. Desserts too chocolatey. It was the night of storm Amy so really noisy but it didnt affect our relaxation. Breakfast delivered; husband had everything bap; I had avocado/tomato bap . There as also pastries and granola. Nice not having to interact with others. We did Spa trail, you have it completely to yourself. I didnt feel rushed. Would have liked a bit more time in relaxation area. It  is expensive; but is unique; genuinely recharged our batteries and very relaxing, Wished we were staying 2 nights || We stayed at Finn Lough from the 1st–4th and it was an absolutely awful experience, especially for what we paid.

The dome was freezing the entire time with no proper heating. We had to wait 10–15 minutes just to get hot water every time, which is ridiculous for “luxury” accommodation. The toilet was open with no real privacy, which made my fiancée extremely uncomfortable for the whole stay.

Breakfast was very poor and nowhere near the standard you would expect for the price.

The worst part was when two members of room service walked into our dome without knocking or announcing themselves while my fiancée was lying in bed. This was a complete invasion of privacy and extremely upsetting.

For the amount of money charged, this experience was nowhere near acceptable. We were expecting a relaxing, high-end getaway and instead it was stressful, uncomfortable, and disappointing. I would not recommend staying here. || From start to finish, the entire team at Finn Lough made our wedding day truly magical. We got engaged at Finn Lough last September, so when we found out they could accommodate our wedding, it felt like fate.

Emma-Kate was so helpful and informative from the very beginning. She went above and beyond to make our day feel personal and full of special touches. Kendall made us feel so welcomed every time we visited — we genuinely felt part of the Finn Lough family, greeted with hugs on arrival.

The night before the wedding, one of our family members had a medical emergency. The staff handled the situation with such calmness, patience, and professionalism, and for that, we are incredibly grateful.

On the morning of the wedding, everything was just a phone call away — from a breakfast platter delivered to our room to a glass of prosecco to start the day. The ceremony in the dome bubble was breathtaking, made even more beautiful by the care and detail the team put into setting it up. We were especially touched that they built the arch we were married under just for us — it made the whole setting feel so personal and unique. The sunshine even appeared at just the right moment, making it all feel magical.

Buggies were provided for guests who needed them, which was perfect. We chose to cut our cake after the ceremony, and the staff outdid themselves with the presentation — a stunning charcuterie board adorned with flowers that made our simple cake feel so special. Thank you so much to Cubbi for that.

The customised cocktails were incredible — thank you to Barry — and the team even created mocktails for our guests who weren’t drinking. Georgia kindly drove us around in the buggy for our couple photos, showing us the best spots to capture some beautiful memories.

Our reception setup was intimate, cosy, and just perfect. The food was absolutely amazing — everyone raved about it — and the kitchen was able to cater to various dietary needs, from vegetarian to complex allergies. Rachel was so attentive throughout, and from a bride’s perspective, I felt like a true princess.

The transition into the evening dancing was seamless thanks to the team’s organisation. A special thank you to Barry and Rachel for constantly checking in and making sure I always had a glass of water — something so small but so appreciated on such a busy day.

Breakfast the next morning was perfect and gave us a lovely moment to say goodbye to our guests. The staff were so organised in packing everything up and ensuring we had all our keepsakes safely returned to us. We also did the Elements Trail Spa the following day, which was the most relaxing way to unwind after such a big day.

We had guests travel from all over the world, and every single one of them commented on how tranquil and special Finn Lough is. It’s a place that perfectly celebrates the natural beauty of this country, incredible talent, and genuine hospitality.

We can’t put into words how magical our day was. A massive thank you to every single person at Finn Lough who made it possible."

Highly recommend and well run by Tomás. || ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5/5 – An Exceptional Sauna Experience with Tomás Houlihan

From the moment you step into Tomás Houlihan’s sauna, you can tell this is something special. The attention to detail, the warmth (in every sense of the word), and the serene atmosphere create an experience that goes far beyond the typical sauna session.

Tomás clearly puts a lot of thought and care into what he does. The heat was perfectly balanced, the setting was calming, and the overall environment felt incredibly rejuvenating. You leave not just relaxed, but restored—both in body and mind.

Whether you’re new to saunas or a seasoned enthusiast, this is a must-visit. Tomás has truly created a sanctuary. I can’t recommend it highly enough."

We spent three wonderful days there, and absolutely everything exceeded our expectations.
The room was beautiful, spotless, and very comfortable. The atmosphere of the castle is magical — elegant interiors, a sense of history, and at the same time a feeling of warmth and relaxation. The level of cleanliness throughout the hotel was impeccable.
The food was excellent, and the service in all the restaurants was attentive, professional, and genuinely welcoming. We especially enjoyed the opportunity to take long, peaceful walks around the castle grounds — the surroundings are perfect for slowing down and fully enjoying the moment.
A special highlight of our stay was lunch at the Douglas Hyde Restaurant. It was an exceptionally pleasant experience that left us with a real sense of satisfaction. First-class food, outstanding service, a lovely atmosphere, and excellent value for money — everything came together perfectly.
Kilronan Castle is a place where you truly feel cared for, and where every detail is thoughtfully considered. We will cherish these memories and would happily return again. || We arrived early at midday. Even driving up the drive and seeing Kilronan Castle on approach gave us the Wow factor!! We had a delicious lunch served by a lovely friendly young lady. After a leisurely drink in their homely beautiful bar, our room was ready. And what a fantastic surprise that was! We had a wonderful 2  1/2 hours in the thermal suite which was included in our package. My friend had 2 treatments which she relished in. The next day before checking out, we availed of their lovely swimming pool, sauna and steam room. We had booked dinner as advised. We opted for casual dining. However it was to such a standard, that we felt we were fine dining! The following morning we had a delicious breakfast. It was the first time anywhere, that we had someone show exactly where everything was in the dining room. Lovely atmosphere and with plenty staff to cater for all your requirements. In all we had a wonderful stay and highly recomend. And will definitely return. || Last month, our friends surprised us with a wonderful wedding gift — a stay at this castle, including dinner at the restaurant and breakfast the next morning.

A very beautiful hotel. It really feels like stepping back in time for a few days. The whole interior is kept in one style — a large antique bed in the room, high ceilings, and polished wooden furniture. At the same time, the room has everything needed for a comfortable stay, including a TV.

The restaurant definitely deserves a special mention. Both the food and the service are of a very high standard. The staff are attentive and professional and are happy to explain each dish.

Overall, the stay left very pleasant impressions. A peaceful atmosphere, a beautiful setting, and the feeling of staying in a real castle. We would love to return. || Absolutely top class!! 5🌟 from start to finish. Beautiful castle, fantastic service & the meal in the Douglas Hyde restaurant was as good as it gets.
The leisure centre is beautiful with so much available from the pool, sauna, steam room, gym, spa etc. can't recommend Kilronan Castle enough. || One of the best, if not the best hotels in Ireland. 5 stars from start to finish. The rooms, reception staff, restaurant staff, the grounds, everything. We loved one one night stay so much that we would strongly get married here. It may be out of the way slightly but I have to say, it would be worth the journey every time. Would go back here in a heartbeat. We absolutely loved it. The staff here are a credit to themselves. The grounds are breathtaking. Food is delicious too."

Definitely not a 4 star hotel whatsoever. Old fashioned and in need of a refurbishment. No entertainment on a Saturday evening. ‘Deluxe’ room was above a smoking area that was in use until after 5am and extremely noisy, to the point I had to ring reception twice, once at 4am and once at 5am to complain. Receptionist- male voice was very unhelpful and had an attitude, I presume at having to leave the reception desk to tell the crowd to be quiet. Breakfast was very poor and the R&R wellness? The sauna didn’t work, changing rooms you have to share with both male and females, no indoor showers. It’s such a let down, just like someone’s back garden with a hottub plunked in it. We ended up not using any of it and leaving. Really annoying when you have spent a lot of money (not worth it) on a stay and are disappointed. Management is apparently contacting myself with a refund but we shall see.  I hate to leave a bad review but sick of places like here taking your money for such poor service. || Myself and my partner now husband got married here in the Errigal country Hotel in Cootehill last Saturday 13/12/2025.

Very helpful, kind, friendly and are amazing at there jobs. All my guests couldn't get over how big the rooms were. Bridal suit was top class. The chef, thank you, the food was absolutely delicious. There wasnt a plate in the room not cleaned off. People are still talking about how good the food was. My band Temptations PJ a local man done us proud the dance floor was never empty. We all danced the night away in a magical ball room all done up for Christmas. Niall thank you from the bottom of my heart for making are day so special from start to finish.
If anyone is newly engaged or getting engaged this Christmas please check out the Errigal hotel in Cootehill for your wedding you will not be disappointed how amazing the place is. I am so happy we choose here, staff, rooms, food ect was unreal. Niall thank you and your team for all you have done for me. X || My 2nd visit here a birthday treat. I done the fab new R&R thermal suite and their €99 spa package. Like last year everything was amazing. prosecco, nibbles in there relaxation room. Fab massage with Shannon and a perfect wash n blow dry and chats with carmelle. Food was AMAZING My fave was the bao bun think it's called. It was so tasty. And the steak sandwich. Service was excellent 👌 Breakfast excellent rooms  immaculate.  And the best part it's so reasonable priced. There was music in the bar too. A great birthday at Errigle for a 2nd year in a row. No doubt I'll be back next year and hopefully a few times. 10/10. || We had a really lovely stay here. The outdoor spa was our highlight. Meal, cocktails etc were gorgeous.

The food was top-notch and received so many compliments from our guests, and the decorations were beautiful — elegant without being overdone, creating exactly the atmosphere we hoped for.

A special mention has to go to the Courtyard Suite, where the bride and bridesmaids got ready on the morning of the wedding. Having breakfast together there and getting ready in such a relaxed, beautiful space really helped calm the nerves and made the whole morning feel so special and memorable.

1st thing staff was fantastic. Couldn't be more helpful.
Bar cold at the  window tables.
Hot chocolate very watery not very good.
Spa the cold pool small and some jets not working but it was very relaxing.
Room bit outdated. And no plugs for phone chargers.
Had to walk past a bunch of builders very friendly people

Breakfast  very nice. No complaints.
Overall  fantastic staff food good. Room just alright.(maybe why builders) || We didn’t stay here but did have my daughter’s christening dinner for 30 of us in one of the private dining rooms. Service was amazing from communication beforehand to on the day. Esp as we had lots of little kids running around, the waiting staff were so patient. Food was excellent. We loved having drinks before and after dinner by the fire in the bar area. Lovely touch from the hotel with a card and teddy for our baby girl. Thanks so much || My partner and I visited for a spa package. The massage itself was lovely and highly professional.
​However, the attention to detail throughout the package was very disappointing. I included a special note on the order for a celebratory reason, and it was completely ignored—not even a simple card was left or any acknowledgement (its free to even say glad you've chosen us hope you have a good time.)
​There were forgotten inclusions: Prosecco and Strawberries were part of our package in the Serenity Suite. (Background we also did a pre-order of food to our suite.) They were never brought out to us within our timeslot. When I alerted the staff (after my times lot as I wanted to make the most of my time there) they did apologize, but then blamed the oversight on being ""distracted"" by our food order, essentially implying it was our fault.
​They eventually brought the forgotten items, but by that point, we were in the Thermal Suite where you can't have food/drink. This meant we had to rush as we also had an hour allotment to the thermal suite to finish this while still wet, in the corridor. This significantly ate into our relaxation time and completely ruined the intended experience.
​The excellent treatment was overshadowed by poor communication, lack of acknowledgement for a special visit, and an overall poor effort on service recovery."

The sauna was properly hot — which was perfect after the cold plunge, and the views from the area are absolutely beautiful.
Although the hot tub wasn’t in operation due to the freezing weather, the owner was incredibly kind and flexible and generously allowed us extra time to make up for it. His friendly, welcoming demeanour really stood out and made the whole experience feel relaxed and personal.
A great setup in a great location, with excellent hospitality to match. Would love to visit again in summer! || Great spot.  We only came for the saunas/ice bath but Tojo was very welcoming and accommodating.  The sauna was roasting with lovely views of the mountains/lake.  The ice bath was proper cold/freezing, as was the outdoor shower, very refreshing.  There was a cabin to get changed/store your belongings.  There is also an outdoor hot tub which we didn't avail of this time but we will be back again to try it out! || Great way to spend an hour relaxing - we opted for the sauna, dip and hot tub option and it didn't disappoint. Hot sauna with eucalyptus, quick plunge in the bath or cold shower followed by hot tub. Appreciated the changing facilities and parking. Definitely recommend 👌 || Our experience at the venue was a mixed bag, with both highlights and areas for improvement.

Scenic elements: The grounds feature beautiful touches like blooming flowers and pear trees, adding charm in parts. Great location.

Cluttered first impression: Unfortunately, the presence of old metal and kitchen equipment around the site detracted from the overall aesthetic and made a poor first impression.

Facilities maintenance: The indoor toilets had a broken door handle in the corridor, making access difficult. The shower area could also benefit from a thorough clean and a general refresh (e.g., paintwork).

Signage & navigation: There was a lack of clear signage throughout the site. The map at the entrance was not particularly helpful, and we had to ask for directions to the meeting point for kayaking/paddle boarding,which still proved difficult to locate.

Customer service: While staff were generally pleasant and carried out their tasks, the overall atmosphere felt transactional. A more proactive and welcoming approach would have made a noticeable difference. Staff not directly involved in your activity came across as indifferent, and we often felt hurried along once our scheduled part was complete.

Activity experience: The information pack mentioned wetsuits would be provided, but none were made available. We had booked paddle boarding but were told only kayaking was possible,citing setup time, even though the session started late due to a delayed family.

Storage & logistics: Storage for personal belongings was disorganized and insecure. Additionally, for guests doing both the wellness and activity experiences, there was no clear process for managing belongings between areas.

Kayaking: The kayaking itself was a lovely experience. However, a little background or storytelling about the lake, canal, or lock would have added depth and connection to the place.

Wellness area: This was a highlight. The cold plunge pool, two saunas (including essential oils), and jacuzzi were all great features. However, we were the only two using the space and were asked to leave after just over an hour, which felt unnecessarily abrupt given how quiet it was.

Communal spaces: The two covered eating areas could use some attention,tidying and general upkeep would improve the visitor experience. || We had an amazing morning kayaking on the lake. The guide was great with the kids and full of great information on the local area. 100% would go again"

The grounds are stunning and very well thought out, incorporating the woodlands inside the cabins and practicing some cool sustainable ideas across the property. The staff were all insanely friendly and welcoming, even with our ten million questions the smiles never ceased to exist. We did the 2-hour wellbeing package that left us feeling zen and  glowing, and the facilities are just enchanting. With the trails on site, the history and surrounding area, there are plenty of fun things to do to keep you busy both inside and outdoors.

Leitrim Village itself is equally as friendly and enjoyable as Drumhierny, having met no strangers in the few days we were there. There’s a sense of passion and pride amongst the town that rallies behind one another’s work and ideas, indicating a strong sense of community and family.

If you’re looking for a place to host a beautiful event, have a romantic getaway or just a relaxing laugh with your friends, this is a perfect spot to do so. Simply put — It’s majestically perfect. || The Welbeing Sanctuary is really wonderful. Even on a December day,  it being outdoors and raining did not dampen the experience. The sauna, jacuzzi and seaweed baths are so warm, clean and relaxing, in a truly beautiful and lush setting. Big thank you to Kathleen, who was so lovely and accommodating. Will definitely be back! || We have just returned from a stay at Drumhierny, a self-professed “unique experience & sanctuary.” We had paid for a two-night stay at the Bird of a Feather lodge, along with two Wellbeing Experiences, which were advertised as 2 hours in the relaxation suite with hot tubs, seaweed or aromatherapy treatments.

We chose Drumhierny over other self-catering stays precisely because of this sanctuary element — we wanted more than just a hot tub. Our plan was to enjoy extra treatments and a glass of bubbly, setting the tone for a relaxing, stress-free getaway.

On arrival, we had to inform reception that our wellbeing session hadn’t been booked. The lady at reception acknowledged this oversight and assured us that someone would call first thing the next morning to arrange it. She even made a note of it in our presence and gave the impression that she genuinely wanted to ensure our experience was everything we expected.

Unfortunately, the promised call never came. We spent much of the day waiting, as this was our final full day before departure, and we wanted to enjoy the experience without rushing. By mid-afternoon, with no progress, we returned to reception (14/10/25) to follow up.

This time we spoke with another receptionist (Throughout this interaction, the second receptionist showed little empathy and offered no apology for the oversight or the disruption to our plans) At first she seemed confused about our wellbeing experience. After some back-and-forth, she offered us a a slot for the following morning — which would have been after we checked out and were due to head home. This was far from ideal and not the relaxing, planned experience we had paid for.

She then said if we went immediately, we could get 40 minutes in the hot tub only. When we expressed our disappointment, she changed the offer to allow us the “full time,” explaining that the sanctuary staff member should have finished work but would stay late. While we appreciated the attempt to resolve it, it hardly created the relaxing atmosphere we had envisioned. We didn’t feel comfortable attending a session knowing the staff were staying on after hours and that it was being squeezed in last minute.

In the end, we were refunded for the Wellbeing Experience which was little comfort as the key part of our stay — the sanctuary experience — simply didn’t happen due to poor communication and follow-through on their end.

The service we received fell well short of expectations. For a place that markets itself as a sanctuary, the lack of organization and empathy was disappointing.

A few additional notes from our stay:

- The main bed consisted of two single beds pushed together, which was not ideal for comfort.

- Privacy in the kitchen and living areas is limited, as passers-by can see directly into the lodge.

- A mid-week stay in autumn offered very little to do in neighbouring towns, so having the sanctuary experience would have been even more valuable.

We had flowers added as an extra 60Euros, these were an exceptional bunch of flowers  and really impressive || Last week we went to the Drumheiry Wellness centre at Drumheiry Woodlands just outside Leitrim village.   This was a fabulous experience in the stunning surroundings of the autumnal trees of the estate.  Mairead on reception is so lovely - she was attentive but also gave us lots of space to enjoy the hot tub and seaweed baths.   This is such a gem hidden in the woods!  I can’t wait to go back! 10 stars!!! || We stayed here mid-week as a group of friends, and couldn't rate it more highly. The lodges are modern, comfortable and well equipped. The staff are incredible and went above and beyond to make our stay as memorable as possible. The spa was also fantastic. 10 out of 10."

(He’s about 12!)
The men’s changing room and showers smell like a nightclub at the end of a busy night. Disgusting. Children using facilities which aren’t fit for purpose:
The cobwebs on my treadmill were newer than the equipment. Because they have decided to sell pool time to lessons and other businesses , you pretty much can’t use the pool or jacuzzi for a lot of time during the day.
Overall…..won’t be taking out a membership. Overpriced. Dirty. Out dated and basically a money making machine for kids swimming classes.
Staff could not care less.
If you like smell of urine and paying a premium for something you could get for less a few miles away, this is the place to go.
Dreadful. || It's great for classes and the staff are very nice but the changing rooms are too hot and too small for the footfall.

I wouldnt mind but we were really enjoying it .
I then joined swimming classes instead,  I did 2 classes but when I went to book week 3 I was told I can't its full. Like this has to change either put more classes on or let us book 6 weeks at a time at least that way you get to finish out a session of classes. So I've missed a class and have to skip to week 4 and I'm already struggling to keep up so I'm gonna be way behind. Very disheartening. Manager needs to change this."

Nothing compares to stepping out into the Atlantic afterwards. While the ocean may not be as icy as some cold plunges depending on the season, its definitely cold enough and the combination of salt water and the benefit of grounding more than makes up for it.

Sauna was 100 degrees plus. Fabulous views over Roberts cove. The sea was clear and the beach clean. One of the best sauna experiences of my life. || 10/10 the best sauna experience I’ve had. The sauna was at a perfect temperature between 95-100 degrees. Robert’s Cove is a sand beach so no need to worry about walking on stones! Sara is an amazing host and even provides a skin scrub for your final dip! || Incredible sauna. Just had the loveliest swim/ sauna session. Sara is a 10/10 host. Head and body feeling great now. She also has a sugar scrub, skin feeling very soft || Swede Sauna is an amazing amenity located in Roberts Cove!
The facilities are perfect for anyone looking to experience hot and cold therapy!
I think it is an ideal way to enjoy swimming in cold open water during the winter months and as soon as we tried the Sauna once we are hooked!

The owner Sara is very friendly. She is really enthusiastic about her business and keeps her Sauna spotlessly clean!
She is always looking into new ways to help make the session a more immersive experience for her customers!
Some of the things Sara does is that she adds essential oils to the water bucket inside the sauna. Then as you pour this water over the hot rocks the steam is infused with the oils.
She also holds birching Sauna sessions, Yoga Sauna sessions and full moon Sauna sessions!

The Sauna:
It is a traditional wood framed Sauna which uses a wood burning stove to produce the heat. The stove is fuelled from the exterior while the body of the stove and chimney is on the inside. There are rocks surrounding the body of the stove and are constantly being heated.
There is a bucket of water beside the stove with a ladle and this can be used to pour water over the rocks to create steam!
There is a hygrometer and a thermometer allowing the customer to monitor conditions within the Sauna. There is also a sand timer in the Sauna rated in 5 minute increments and a maximum of 15 minutes. This ideal to track your session and wearing an electronic watch or metal watch is not ideal in the hot and humid environment of the Sauna!

Benefits for me:
I'm not going to claim all the benefits that some people say that Saunas and cold water swimming can aid to however, I do feel amazing after a session and Sara's Sauna is in the perfect location for me.
I love immersing myself in the cold water for a few minutes and then going for about a 15 minute sweat and then back into the water. Each time that we have went so far we have gone for an hour and we aim to get 4 to 5 dips with each session.
The amount of swims or how long you want to spend in the Sauna is all up to you and I find the sand timer great for this!

Cost:
I think the Sauna is very reasonable at €10 for half an hour or €20 for a full hour. This is for an open session where you and others can come and go as you or they please.
There is the option of booking a private session for €85 for an hour. This is also reasonable in my opinion as if you can split it with 5 or more friends it works out cheaper than an open session!

Tips:
I would look at the tide times so that you can avail of the high tide and don't have to walk to far from the Sauna to get to the water.
Opening times change everyday as I believe Sara follows the high tide so it could be a morning session or an evening session that she is open for.
Bring 2 towels as you will need a fresh towel to dry off afterwards and I recommend to sit on a different one so that you keep it clean/hygenic for other Sauna users!

Overall opinion:
I think that the experienct you get at Swede Sauna is brilliant! Sara is very friendly and the location can't be beaten!
I highly recommend giving it a try, you won't be disappointed! || Have visited Swede Sauna 3 times in the last couple of months with family and friends. Visited at the weekend and  2 out of the 3 times Sara had overbooked the sauna so wasnt as enjoyable experience as other saunas I tried around Cork. Online booking says it holds 8 people but Sara has over booked it to be 12 people. Its too much of a tight squeeze and then youre coordinating with other between re who is in the sauna vs in the sea. The first time it happened Sara said it was an accident that it was overbooked by mistake but then it happened a second time I visited so I think its something that happens regularly. Such a shame as its a gorgeous location, just not very relaxing when youre packed in with too many people. Won't be back unfortunately."

We were only in Kinsale for 1 night and upon arrival, I stumbled across the sauna on google maps.

Wild Atlantic Seaweed Baths is truly unique and super cool. You get to relax in recycled Irish whiskey barrels turned into hot saltwater tubs, filled with seaweed that’s amazing for your skin. The setup overlooks the Atlantic Ocean, with the breathtaking Cliffs of Moher in the distance—it doesn’t get more magical than that.

There’s also a cozy hot sauna, and since the number of tubs and sauna spots are limited, it never feels crowded. It’s incredibly relaxing to soak while listening to the waves crash against the shore. On top of that, you meet people from all over the world, which makes the experience even more special.

The staff are wonderful—so friendly and helpful, which adds to the welcoming vibe. I absolutely loved it, and can’t recommend it enough. If you’re in the area, this is something you don’t want to miss! || If you’re contemplating it, DO IT! It’s a remarkable experience ~ sitting in replenishing Irish seaweed, warm and cozy to the bone with the fresh Atlantic sea breeze and views of the coast. The staff were so lovely and helpful.

There are no bathrooms, so bring your clothes and towel to get changed in a nook behind the sauna.

Loved it! || Exhausted parents, this is the treat for you! We had the pleasure of (taking turns!) and basking in oh so comfortable seaweed hot-tub on a beautiful spring day on our sons first trip to the coast. The staff were extremely friendly, accommodating and genuinely nice which made it all the easier to sit back, relax and watch the waves roll in. The local seaweed and hot-water on demand was a great touch, meaning we were able to top the tub ensuring it stayed nice and hot throughout our session. It was so relaxing, I didn’t want to get out! The perfect seaside experience, I have bought it as a gift for friends and family since. Highly recommend || Wild Atlantic Seaweed Baths was genuinely one of the best experiences I have ever had. The staff were warm, kind, and so welcoming, which made the visit feel special from the start. I definitely recommend booking your own tub. Having that private time to fully relax, soak, and take in the experience without rushing made it unforgettable. The entire atmosphere is calming, unique, and something I think everyone should try at least once. I would return in a heartbeat. || What an amazing experience!
My first experience at Wild Atlantic Seaweed baths did not disappoint and it won't be my last. From the friendly introductions from Owen & Eoin, the breathtaking views, hot water on demand, luscious seaweed, option of cold water plunge and shower this was  a great experience. We felt renewed, revitalised and relaxed after this experience and we will be back! Thank you"

The experience is a sauna and spa experience on the banks of the beautiful lake which is perfect for the cold dips. The full moon session was incredible with a built fire and tea and some snacks. Thank you for your love and care, Anna!! || Had a wonderful visit to Birchwood sauna with my friends recently. The sauna temperature and treatment was excellent and the essential oil salts, ginger and lemon drink and powerball to finish were a fantastic addition.

Perfect when you pull up in a cruise boat on the Shannon. || Went with 6 friends and it was a lovely experience - we LOVED the essential oils and homemade scrubs. My friends and I pulled the boat in at Mountshannon - it was great to get to swim in the lake and then hop back into the lovely warm sauna. I booked via messaging the Instagram page - was quick and easy and would recommend to all! The owner is very friendly. Great local business! || As if the sauna experience right on the lake front wasn't good enough, Anna provides refreshing infused water, lovely homemade body scrubs and delicious treats for after the session. The essential oils used for the steam smells amazing and it was a 10/10 experience all round! || A wonderful sauna experience. Anna is such a great host. There are various handmade bodyscrubs, very fine energy balls, of course also homemade, and a small, fine, aromatic infusion.

✅ swimming pool
✅ hot tube outside with an amazing view
✅ sauna AND a steaming room
✅ relaxing indoor jacuzzi

✅ gym - let’s face it you will need it after breakfast like this
✅ aqua aerobics
✅ swimming classes
✅ bridge tournaments…..

Did I mention the view??? I mean… not. a. single. flaw!

Photo of my dinner 😃 || This is a great old historic hotel.  The rooms are very comfortable, but the furnishings do look a bit dated.  Rooms have old fashioned keys, not the electronic cards that we're used to.  These rooms are not air conditioned, so they could get warm in the summer months.  We were there in October and although is was very cool outside, the room did get warm. I made sure the radiator was off and the window was open, day and night.  One night we had to request a fan to cool it down.  The service was great and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The food in the restaurants was great too!  While we were there, there was 2 weddings taking place! || The Falls Hotel was a lovely host during my recent visit to Cliffs of Moher.  The property is quite large. My room was spacious with a view of the falls.  The bathroom was large with tub and separate rain shower.  The breakfast is spectacular!  There is a pool and gym for guests. The hotel is comfortable and full of history. || This was our second time staying here, and again it was great, such a lovely clean hotel, great staff, great food, 13th December is their party night so plenty of buzz around the hotel. The swimming pool and hot tubs are great, not packed, clean, cosy. Would recommend for families and groups of friends, company parties, etc. || Just enjoyed a overnight dinner b&b at this lovely hotel. Spectacular views of the falls as well as being pampered by the staff at dinner and breakfast. Couldn't ask for better. Leisure center is lovely but the icing on the cake is the outdoor jacuzzi..at night while its raining so cool."

It was the most relaxing weekend I’ve honestly ever had.  It has now replaced the Maldives as my No.1 Happy Place. Worth every cent. I’ll definitely be returning. || I had the most beautiful time last weekend. From the yoga, to the food and the breathtaking views it was everything I needed for a perfect reset.

The retreat itself is stunning and a very tranquil experience. Highly recommend to anyone looking to further their holistic treatments and career. Thank you Rosie and Micheal at the Shannon estuary! || I went here recently for a WIM HOFF day retreat and it was amazing from start to finish. Michael and Rosie are so welcoming and friendly, I felt right at home. The experience was wonderful, I have been an avid cold water swimmer in lakes but I felt like I really learned a lot more about techniques for breathing when entering the water, when in the water and when warming up out of the water. There was great learning and fun all rolled into one. The facilities are top-notch from the cold water barrel, sauna to the hot tub.

I was nervous about doing the dance afterwards to warm up again but I wasn't long getting into it with the encouragement of everyone else and of course the benefit of it.

There was a delicious meal afterwards and no rush to leave. On the day itself, there was rain as I was driving there and then the clouds began to part and the sun came out - truly wonderful to watch this as you sit upstairs with the large glass landscape windows.

A truly unique experience, I would recommend to anyone curious. I came away with a lot of knowledge, a full heart and new friends.

Try it, you won't regret it. || It's very hard to describe the experience you will have at Shannon Estuary Way without fully experiencing it. I am currently undertaking the 200 hour yoga fusion training and to say it is the best decision I've made would be an understatement. The care, effort, support and knowledge from Rosie and Micheál is outstanding. The course is so informative, interesting and easily integrated into every day life. The space itself is like a warm hug and I look forward to going there on our weekend trainings, it truly feels like a retreat every month. The food is also a massive talking point every lunch and break, it is fresh, nourishing and locally sourced with the best ingredients. Meeting such like- minded people, learning from them and the connections and friendships made has been amazing. Rosie and Micheál are also extremely supportive and are at hand to answer any questions, give advice or simply just an encouraging word. I feel very lucky to be on this journey with them and my group. I couldn't recommend the Shannkn Estuary Way Retreat more and I will certainly be returning for more training after completing this one. || I completed my sound therapy training at the Shannon Estuary Retreat with Rosie and Michael, and it was a truly beautiful experience. The centre is stunning — peaceful, grounding, and surrounded by nature. Rosie and Michael are incredibly knowledgeable, warm, and supportive, creating a nurturing and professional learning environment. I left feeling inspired, confident, and deeply grateful. I couldn’t recommend this retreat or the training more highly.
If i could give more stars I would!!! Make sure to check it out they offer so many amazing trainings and offerings! || The Shannon Estuary Way Retreat is a really special place. Went here with my Friend Brian for the Wim hoff retreat and it was an incredible experience and would highly recommend to anyone. Micheál who runs the retreat with his wife Rosie is really welcoming and kind. His knowledge and training of the Wim Hoff techniques were top class.The retreat is set in an idyllic location looking out across the spectacular Shannon Estuary and the ice baths,Sauna and hot tub are brilliant. Also we had an amazing vegetarian meal that was really fresh and tasty. A full 5 stars and would highly recommend for men and women and for anyone from all walks of life.

Recommended for a full night out of amazing drinks! || Been going here a while and every night here is a fantastic night. But last Friday we met the bartender Alan WHO WAS MAGNIFICENT 🤩 and that made me have to write a review just to give him a shout out 🤴
He made the best espresso martinis I’ve ever had in Ireland ☕️🍸and his charisma is ✨unmatched✨. Best guy around. || I had a birthday party at the gaia recently and I couldn't recommend it more. The Gaia has the perfect combination of the buzz and atmosphere of a club and the intimacy and social aspect of a pub.The venue is gorgeous but what made it stand out was the outstanding service and staff : Allen, John and Darren made sure myself and my party were all well taken care of and took the time to have a bit of banter with us in between it all.
Hats off to all the staff and everyone working in the backround for Gaia. Great spot. 👍👍👍"

You can jump right in the ocean, use the barrels, or there is a cold shower, too. The sauna is the perfect size cosy but not cramped.

Really, if I could start every day like that, I would be winning. If you are in Youghal, don't miss your chance it books up quickly. || What a beautiful place! Watching the sea and warming up before and after a swim was lovely. Also a tub of cool water outside if you don’t want to make a dash to the sea. The sauna itself is in excellent condition and welcome was wonderful too. Thank you for a lovely time! || A wholesome and enjoyable weekend activity. Beautiful views from the sauna, a big barrel outside to dip into to cool down if you don't wish to run into the sea. The owner Michelle is very friendly. Activity is very good value!"

Came down all the way from Cork for morning session at 9am on Thursday just to see saunas locked up.
I contacted Coastal Cabin an evening before to confirm they are open from 8am (as written on the cabin). They confirmed and there was no show.
Came back home after wasting time and petrol.
Very disappointing. || I've been here loads of times and plan to keep going and would recommend. Good for the mind, body and soul. || Great position to the beach - booking was simple - friendly staff. || Came here for the first time 2 days ago and LOVED it. Beautiful hand made sauna, nice spot where the salt water will cater to any wounds in between and lovely owner. Wonderful smells of eucalyptus inside when I was there to help open up the lungs so aromatherapy on top of it all. || Not one bit honest Was hired 4 months ago to create a video I filmed and edited a video for them (guessing which way they wanted the video to look as wasn’t given direction) they didn’t like first video I sent which was fair enough I was only guessing what they wanted because they never told me they kept saying they’d get onto me and let me know what they wanted pushing me back saying they’ll get onto me to change video and create a new one 4 months later they got onto me saying they won’t be using me never once told me what way they actually wanted the video not even a five minute phone call wasting time and money. I could’ve easily edited a video they wanted but no contact with 4 months telling me what they needed complete waste of time and money"

Also Caoimhe gave me some practical advice on how to minimise tension going forward. Nice relaxing area with tea, coffee, snacks is a lovely touch.

Loved the whole experience and refreshments after would go back 🥰 || I cannot recommend the massage experience at Bellevue spa in Cork with Pablo at the Montenotte hotel enough! From start to finish, everything was absolutely perfect. The calming ambiance of the spa was pure bliss, and from the moment I walked through the door, I was greeted warmly and made to feel completely at ease.

Pablo, my massage therapist, was simply brilliant. He was incredibly knowledgeable and highly skilled, tailoring the treatment to my specific needs and preferences. He consistently checked in with me throughout the massage to ensure I was comfortable and relaxed, really taking the time to get to know me and my needs. He used a combination of techniques that left me not only feeling rejuvenated but also invigorated.

One of the best parts of my experience was the quiet room, where I was encouraged to unwind and take a moment to myself. Sipping on a glass of champagne made for the perfect touch to end my tranquil treatment. It's clear that Bellevue Spa values their guest's experience, and I appreciated every moment spent in their care.

Overall, the Bellevue spa at the Montenotte hotel in Cork is an absolute must-try for anyone in the area. The entire experience is simply sensational, and I know that I will be back time and time again. Thank you to Pablo and the team at Bellevue spa for a truly unforgettable experience! || I booked the ”Ho-Leaf and Rosemary Muscle Melt”  for my mom to treat her for Mother’s Day. I personally didn’t experience the massage, however since it was her first massage I wanted her to have the best experience, which it was. She shared that it was the best thing she has ever felt. It was a 10/10 experience for her, she said the masseuse was so welcoming and extremely kind, making her feel so comfortable. The massage was very relaxing and she stated it relived all the tension and stress in her muscles.

As I can say, Evie, the receptionist is so kind hearted and helpful. From the moment we arrived, even just stepping foot into the reception area I felt at ease. I could tell that the spa was exactly what it claims to be. The cleanliness and atmosphere of the whole spa was impeccable.

Finally I would like to add that both me and my parents were both so impressed with the Spa. It is definitely worth-while looking into all their packages and deals. If you’re staying at the Montenotte Hotel, definitely book yourself in for the spa. Personally I will be returning here in the future. || Beautiful spa and great staff! Rachel did a wonderful job on a full-body massage. Very happy with the spa and highly recommend it if you are in the area. || Loved my treatment, beautiful atmosphere , great staff from concierge at front door who is always so lovely to the girls in the spa equally kind.

The resort is in a great location, service was top class and the food could not be faulted. From the moment we stepped in we were made feel welcome. The door man Michael I think it was really made our trip. So welcoming every time and very helpful and informative.

We stayed in a double room. Very spacious. The bathroom is spotless and the cleaners did a stellar job.

We enjoyed our stay so much we extended for a day. The price quoted at reception was quite a bit more expensive than booking on hotels.com or bookings.com. We said this to them and they matched the price instantly. Very happy with all interactions. || This hotel is amazing!! The whole property is huge and so pretty. We got there at night and left the next day, so we weren’t able to use the spa, but it looked amazing. We ate dinner and had breakfast here and everything was really good. Really fresh ingredients and great quality. The room was beautiful and had a bath tub which was so nice because it was so cold, so taking a warm bath was just what I needed. The staff was so kind as well. I recommend this hotel to anyone going to Ireland! || 5* doesn’t give this hotel justice. Top class service with Irish hospitality at its finest.  Was there for 3 days with family of 10. Service was exceptional, standard was beyond amazing and place was spotless. Like with any venue the staff are the backbone and the making of the experience. Everyone person we met was lovely, personable and very professional. Will be back. || Good sized rooms, with a good selection of amenities and comfortable too. Check in and check out was quick as was services in the best and restaurant. The hotel itself is a little shabby in spots and showing its age a little, it's a pure Celtic Tiger creation. It was a little cold too as they haven't turned on the heating and this was late October. Beautiful setting. || We recently stayed here as a family for a few nights and were so happy with our stay. We booked a family room and on booking we were unable to add the no. of children to the booking so we rang and informed them over the phone. We gave the age of our children (one newborn baby) on the call.

When we got to the room there was a beautiful fruit platter and teddy bear in the room congratulating us on our new baby which was lovely and really appreciated. The room was also really spacious and clean with a big bathroom. The beds were very comfortable.

We used the pool which was also clean and could be booked easily and the breakfast in the morning was great with lots of options for everyone.

One of the days we visited Fota Wildlife Park which is just a few minutes drive away and another we spent walking the Fairy Trail on the hotel grounds. The spa facilities are great to unwind with a lovely relaxation room overlooking a peaceful courtyard which you can use after a treatment. There is also a 'cinema room' showing movies for older kids.

Overall I highly recommend a family stay here and we're looking forward to coming back."

They also explained how the spa treatment works on the body more than anyone ever did for me in medical school.

Came here after hiking Mt. Carrountoohill and felt no pain whatsoever in my body after doing the lactic flush.

Highly recommend to come here after any hike to recover and have a fantastic time! || I came here last week, as a regular sauna and swim user I was curious to see what this retreat centre had to offer. I was genuinely blown away by the location, the facilities and with Paul’s friendly and professional demeanour. The experience was unlike anything I’ve experienced from a regular swim and sauna thus far. It lasted 2.5 hours and I felt completely relaxed and renewed afterwards.

I highly recommend checking this out if you’re interested in the benefits of saunas and contract heat therapy.

She was very good, it was really relaxing and she was very helpful and friendly. I got the rainforest treatment which included an exfoliation, wrap and massage. The refreshments and relaxation area were lovely. Really enjoyed the whole experience. Everything was well sanitised and it never felt like you were too close to others. All therapists wearing masks. My only complaint is the group of women who were talking and laughing very loudly non-stop in all of the relaxation areas.

Gym very dated though and dressing rooms definitely need work. Music is far too loud as most people use their own headphones. Also no one follows the rules. People are always shaving in the men’s dressing rooms which is disgusting. Don’t wear footwear in saunas etc. Always putting those smelly oils in the sauna which I hate. Not wiping down machines. Staff do nothing to stop any of this. Definitely needs an app as well to book classes. Most other gyms have this now. Overall it’s really slipping behind other more modern facilities || Equipment itself was good however wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone looking for just a single months membership. I got a membership here as I travel for work and it was convenient, I signed up then instantly filled out a cancellation form as they recommended however I have been charged for another month and they are ignoring all my emails and instagram messages I’ve sent through (4 and counting) shocking behaviour. || Pretty decent gym & swimming pool, the facilities and management could definitely be improved though.

The main focus seems to be on the gym there, which has 4 huge rooms full of equipment. There's also a separate ladies gym.
As a casual gym-goer, I find that there's a great selection of cardio machines, strength training machines, and loads of free weights. The gym is usually pretty busy during peak times, but you'll always be able to find a spot somewhere.
There's also 2 studios for classes, which can be also be used while there's no classes ongoing.

The pool is grand. It does the job. It's 15m and there's no deep / shallow end, it's all the same depth. There's also a sauna and steam room. There are much better and bigger pools around though, so if you're only wanting to join for the pool, I would consider other options.
The changing rooms, I think, are the biggest downfall. They could definitely be improved. They are open plan, which is fine I guess, but as a very self conscious person, it makes me uncomfortable. There also doesn't seem to be any consideration for gender non-conforming people, as there's only male or female.
There are lockers but you need to bring a lock yourself for them, which is pretty standard. Many of the lockers are broken though, so there's no way to lock them. Generally I've been able to find an available, not broken one though.
The showers leave a lot to be desired. They have frosted glass swinging doors, kind of like a saloon door, but they don't meet fully in the middle so you do feel kind of exposed. I've started hanging my towel spread out completely over it for a bit more privacy, but that doesn't feel very hygienic. There is a basket to put shampoo, etc into, but I haven't seen any hooks to hang things on, which would be nice to have. They have also smelled pretty bad a few times I've been there.
The hairdryers are also, unfortunately very bad. There doesn't seem to be any high power setting so it would take hours to dry your hair completely.

Initially I went down there and asked it I could do a trial run before committing to a membership. Was told they don't do that, and they don't do guest passes so the only options are to sign up immediately (and I believe commit to paying at least 3 months before you can cancel, but I can't quite remember because you don't get any copy of everything you signed) or go elsewhere. They gave me a quick tour of the place though.
So I signed up for a membership because it's within walking distance for me and has basically what I need.
While filling out the forms, I ticked the box to say that I would like to have a gym orientation. According to their website all memberships include ""personalized programs"", but I told them I'd just like to be shown how to use a few of the machines to get started and get a feel for the place and I might look for a specific program later. Was told to come back on 'x' day at 'y' time for it. Grand. Showed up at the specified date and time and they had no idea what I was talking about and didn't have me booked in for anything and had no one there to do an orientation. The lad at reception just gave me (another) tour of the gym, but he was at least very nice about it. || Great place to push your body to the limits. Best hours to train are 6-11am and  8:30-10pm as place is not as crowded. Good selection of machines and free weights. || Absolute disgrace 6 weeks waiting for steam room to be fixed people having to queue for the sauna"

The food at the restaurant was amazing and the service was awesome. We got on with the service manager Kieran (sorry if I spelled his name incorrectly) and he was so easy to talk to and a really nice fellow.
Would 100% recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway. You won't be disappointed. || I recently stayed at The Maryborough Hotel & Spa in Cork, and it was pleasant from start to finish. Nestled in the leafy Douglas area, the hotel perfectly balances comfort with easy access to the city. The old Georgian manor house and gardens all decked out with Christmas 🎄 trees and lights create a stunning backdrop that immediately sets a relaxing tone.

The staff on the whole were consistently warm, attentive, and professional nothing ever felt like too much trouble. From the Spa to the restaurant team, everyone went out of their way to make the stay feel special.

Dining at Bellini’s Restaurant was a highlight. The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor, with excellent options for all dietary preferences.

Breakfast was equally impressive, offering both hearty Irish classics and lighter choices.

The ESPA spa and leisure facilities are world-class. The thermal suite, pool, and treatments provided the perfect escape, and the health club’s narrow indoor pool was a bonus.

Whether you’re visiting for business or a romantic getaway, the hotel caters to every occasion with style and charm.

Overall, The Maryborough is a luxurious yet welcoming, historic hotel.

I left feeling refreshed due to the insanely comfy bed and pillows and already planning my return. I Highly recommended for anyone seeking a memorable stay in Cork. || This is a 2 star hotel with a 4 star reception area. Very disappointed with the Maryborough from the moment we left the reception area. The entire hotel is just run down. The rooms where very gruby with handprints, chips and paint splatter on the walls (see photos). Some of the light switches just didn't work either. The switch for the reading light didn't work on my side but did on my partners. As you can see in the pics, very amateur wiring done on the back of the headboard. Our room was headboard to headboard with the adjacent room which must also have had the same botch job done of sealing the wall as we could hear every word that was said in the other room.

Spa was what really drove me to write this review. Very very unkept, not dirty, just unkept. Thermal room had a plastic bag and 2 cups floating in the water which I had to bin. The whole time we waited for our treatments not one member of staff came in to do a check, or clean. Relaxation beds were broken and gruby.

The service in general was very very poor. Breakfast has a set menu but good luck getting anyone to take your order, and god forbid you ask for something additional because you will be in for a long wait. Staff write down your order and just never come back. Simple things like ""can I get ketchup"" just don't happen until the 4th time asking. Overall the staff were rude and unhelpful, not making room to move in the bar, or restaurant just barging passed because what they are doing is very important. They aren't very welcoming either. If you're unhappy working over new years get another job. || Lovely people lovely place.
Two nights here in the pouring rain as storm Bram approaches.  We have eaten lunch in the bar, it was very good, seafood chowder then fish and chips.
Breakfast, great choices on offer, I had a very rich omelette, coffee great, atmosphere relaxed for a Sunday.
The room, large warm as is the bed.
Great weekend getaway. || This hotel was beautiful!  The location was perfect - just outside of town for easy access, and peaceful.  The breakfast that was included was delicious and the staff were very helpful and kind.  Oh and the beds and pillows were so comfortable!  We would definitely stay here again if we are ever in the area!"

It's a calm beach but may require aqua shoes if going for a swim. Found lots of sharp shells along the shore. My only disappointment was that there wasn't a single bin provided by the council. There was so much of rubbish flying around, it was heartbreaking. Not a bad spot for bird watching too! || Nice long sandy beach in Ringaskiddy. Next to factory there is a concrete walkway, to the beach.
Lot of shell all over although nice sandy shore. In april it is windy, but in the summer it is the perfect family beach. Dogs also enjoying beach.😊 || Really nice place, quiet and clean beach..
Not too far from the city...
One of not so well known beach in Cork.
Only problem is not enough parking place, otherwise it would deserve 5 star || U might need a car to get here. There isn't a huge parking. It's a nice place to walk your dogs who enjoys the water. Visited there on a cloudy weather and was quite windy, so it was cold. Surely though, people will enjoy this beach if it was a nice sunny weather. Sand was very fine, so wear Ur slippers. There's 2 wind mills nearby which is a great feature. There's a lot of shells near the water. Thing tho is, the portable toilet stinks. Otherwise, it's free and u can still enjoy nature by the beach"

You must be determined and practicing between lessons will help.
So here's my advise, take a series of one-to-one lessons with Giada. She's just brilliant.
I previously took 6 group and 2 one-to-one lessons at a different pool but still out of breath after a few strokes.
Giada identified my specific errors and explained/demonstrated how to rectify them. After the 6 lessons I'm now very confident in the pool and capable of swimming full
lengths. || My 11 month old son has been attending baby swimming classes at District for the last 7 months.  He loves it, the swimming instructor is excellent with all the babies & makes each session fun.
The changing room facilities are ideal for mom & baby, there is a little play pen so mommy can get dressed.

The complex is amazing. It is a fantastic gym, with many classes, there are squash courts, tennis courts & a lot more.

I dealt with a lady called Catherine a lot, she is friendly & very helpful. || Brilliant gym with very friendly reception staff . Been a member for the last few months having previously been with dennehys . While district is more expensive you do get what you pay for imo . Plenty of machines & everything is well serviced .

Both gym floors and equipment are fantastic,  the pool is excellent with a sauna. Changing rooms always clean and fresh. || District is a fantastic Gym, facilities are excellent, several different areas to work out, and an extensive range of classes.

We were the only guests on the compound as it was during the off peak season and on a weekday. The views were stunning, so serene and peaceful!

The amenities in the lodge were great. We ordered the dinner for 2 and it was amazing! The best part of it all was that we had Charlie our golden retriever with us :) We really did not want to leave! Highly recommend and will definitely stay again! || This is an absolutely fantastic little hideaway to get away from the hustle and bustle. Comfortable beds, tidy equipped kitchen and cosy.

A total surprise yo find a mobile sauna on the pier, apparently they're a 'ting' around these parts. Research West Cork Sauna for venues, times and booking. || Beautiful place, there are coves with clear water you can go swim.
At the pier, facing the water, if you go to the right, after a few meters you can see a path, there's a gate, lead to different coves .
Try walk all the paths as there are different spots you can swim. || Amazing spot for a swim, with clear water and not much seaweed.
When the tide is in you can even jump off the end of the pier.

There is an unofficial one way system when driving down, the way dowm starts by a house on the main road and the way back passes the quarry. || According to some people it doesn't exist as a name or as a place, because no Irish words begin with a Z.

I really enjoyed the little extra touches like the incense burning, the tranquil music and especially the aufguss, which is something I have never experienced in a sauna in Ireland. Couldn’t recommend this little gem enough. Will be back next time I’m in Dingle ❤️ || This sauna was a highlight of my trip to Dingle. The location is gorgeous, the sauna is steps from a beautiful sandy beach, making the cold plunge in the ocean easy.

There wasn’t much information online, so we had to figure it out as we went. Bring your own towels and sandals. The changing area is very limited. After booking online, all you have to do is show up and sauna! The staff was very helpful and kind, we enjoyed chatting with the woman working.

If you’re expecting a traditional Finnish sauna, this isn’t it, the benches are a single level, and it’s not particularly hot (averaged 80 degrees C while we were there).

We would happily return to the Hayfield Manor hotel next time we are in Cork. || The service at Hayfield manor hotel was perfect! Turn down service, bags to the room, welcome drink and early check in. All staff were so attentive.

Our classic room had everything you could need loved the beige tones and the marble in the bathroom. The pillows weren’t so comfortable and we could hear noise of chairs below us from 12am until 1am not sure if it was the bar.

We also went to the spa which had an outdoor jacuzzi and steam room, plenty of extra towels and slippers.

Dinner in Orchids was nice, our steaks were cooked perfectly! We had a drink in Bloom in the garden but the atmosphere there wasn’t our favourite it smelled of beer and was very quiet so we went inside to the manor bar. The selection of cocktails is quiet poor for the price. For €20 per drink I’d like to see more flavours, names and a dedicated cocktail menu. The two we did try were average.

The hotel is cosy and classic, some birds at the side of the manor and nice little area to walk around even though theres no gardens. Breakfast was lovely I can tell why it’s so highly rated, we loved the scones! || Amazing hotel with unbelievable staff. From the moment you walk in the door, the festive decor and smell was amazing. Staff were so helpful, it’s impossible to pick out anyone in particular. Superb 5 star service. The full size Christmas tree in the bedroom was also unreal! Cannot praise this hotel anymore. Will definitely be returning. Food was so amazing in Perrotts restaurant. || The nicest Christmas gift of time together that we gave each other as a family was a night away in the Hayfield. Bearing in mind, we brought our teenage son & as any parent knows, teenagers are notoriously difficult to impress, but we were all agreed, it was the injection of Christmas Spirit we all needed & enjoyed. With the warmest of welcomes, exceptional service & kindness, our beautiful dinner in Perrott's, to the comfort of our room, we were so spoiled. Add in thoughtful wee touches of the card & the teen was walking on air & wanted to move in. The hotel was decorated so nicely for Christmas, with music by talented musicians drifting from the inviting lobby into the bar and restaurant areas, all enhance the atmosphere. It was delightful from start to finish. As you can see in the pictures, the teenager was thoroughly impressed & planning his next visit already."

The level of cleanliness was shocking. Floors around the pools area were covered with dirt, hair, used plasters and debris, and it looked as if they hadn’t been cleaned for days (at least).
The water in the 18-metre pool was cloudy(!), and the glass panels separating the pools were covered with old, dried stains.
The changing rooms were unusable — in most of them there were clothes and bags left behind, making it impossible to get changed.

The hotel is just stunning, very warm and welcoming. The food we had was 5 star all the way, absolutely delicious. A very special mention to Jack on Reception who was very helpful and informative. All the staff were happy and there was a great atmosphere at all times, you can tell they are happy in their jobs. The only thing we missed were bathrobes in the room which would have been handy as we used the leisure centre a few times and Netflix was not available on the TV's. That aside, I would highly recommend this hotel. We will be back soon. || We spent NYE at the kinsale hotel and spa.

The staff was friendly and the food was really good (we pre-booked the special new year dinner)
Breakfast was great with lots of delicious savoury and sweet options.

The spa was a bit of a letdown however. The sauna and steam room were ok but the swimming pool was really disappointing: none of the jets, small water waterfalls or reclining bubble beds were working. In total only 1 of the 8 ""stations"" in the pool was working (the standing bubbles).
The whirlpool seemed to constantly be taken by other people who had just finished their gym session.

The rooms were spotless and comfortable.

Overall it would've been a great stay if only the swimming pool had been repaired... || Tammy, Sarah and Jack couldn’t have been more accommodating when sorting out different needs for my family during a large group stay over Christmas and New Year's. Spotless rooms, great food with lots of things to do with children, walks on the grounds, a swimming pool and a playground. Will definitely be back! || Wow, what can I say? We got married here on Saturday! 💍✨

We planned the whole wedding all the way from Australia, and our first night at the hotel was the evening before the big day. 🇦🇺✈️

Laura and John were absolutely outstanding, the perfect duo. Nothing was ever too much to ask for. 👏
The bar staff were dancing and great craic, and the wait staff were amazing. 🍹💃 The chef even came out to check on us personally. As someone who’s gluten-free, I really appreciated how accommodating they were. 🙏🍽️

I had one issue regarding reservations, and John made me feel truly heard and that meant the world. 💬❤️

The food was delicious and one guest even said it was the best salmon she’s ever had! 🐟😋

John, I hope you finally found some grapefruit juice! 😄 Also, thanks to Dino.

My mum passed away in May so it was a tough day but everyone helped make it feel truly magical. ✨

Thank you all for making our day so special. 🙌💕 || We attended a wedding here 2 weeks ago. From start to finish we couldn't have asked for more. Our rooms were ready early, the staff were so accommodating and friendly.  The food and the views were spectacular.  Thank you for a great day and night."

Actually called too and the guy started making things complicated and saying how difficult delivery etc is, at which point I told him not to bother. || Janius provided a great service - he provided a lot of details about the different hot tub options, allowing me to make an informed decision about which to purchase. He was always very communicative and was very flexible about delivery, working around my schedule and the builders who were fitting the decking. On seeing the site, he advised a longer flue would be appropriate and came round the next day to fit it. All in all, an excellent service. Thank you! || Took delivery of Hot Tub last week and we are 100% happy.   The product is sturdy and beautifully finished.  Lit the first fire and 2 hours later it was up to temp and so inviting !
Our communication with John was perfect. John suggested 4 to 6 weeks lead time the tub was installed within 4 weeks of ordering. John kept contact during the 4 weeks and gave great advice on positioning and installation.

We would not hesitate in recommending Luxury Hot Tubs Ltd if you are considering one of the products offered by this company. || I've had my HotTub for over a year now and we still use it weekly. We've had 0 issues with it. At one point when we wanted to extend the flue and Jaunius was able to help us out with that which is much appreciated. The HotTub itself is also extremely well insulated and we only lose a few degree's overnight which is quite easy to warm back up again. Jaunius was also able to guide us on how to maintain the water which we've now become experts at and it's also quite easy to clean the tub. Initially when we were looking into getting a HotTub Jaunius was also able to guide us through all the various options and features to choose what was best for us.
-Barry Mc || So happy with our new sauna. It's a high quality product and a lovely addition to our garden! The wood burning stove is very powerful. The whole buying experience with John was smooth and efficient and the installation took only one day. Highly recommend you check out their hot tubs and saunas."

I actually did not want to go home after two nights away here, I was so relaxed and comfortable. The service from the lovely staff, the food, and the amenities are second to none. We had dinner for our engagement anniversary and it tasted absolutely amazing - food we had elsewhere on the second night seemed so bland by comparison. The drinks and cocktails were delightful also in The Glasshouse and the live music in both the restaurant and bar makes it truly special. Breakfast was amazing - an excellent continental selection for making a yoghurt and berry bowl with seeds and nuts, a huge selection of cooked food, and eggs cooked to order. Liked the coffee also, both in the room and at the restaurant. The pool and amenities were very quiet and spacious - as a person who wanted some quiet time, this was amazing to not be struggling for personal space. Loved the free cinema each night; a special treat. The gardens are very tranquil with interesting sculptures and beautiful to look out on from the balconies. I will certainly be back again soon. Worth every cent! || From the moment we arrived, our stay at The Montenotte Hotel felt special. Though the entrance from the road is on a sharp turn and a little awkward to navigate, the warm welcome from the staff immediately set a positive tone. Martha at reception was very helpful, offering thoughtful local recommendations and a great overview of the hotel’s amenities, including the in-house cinema — something we’re already looking forward to returning to try.
Our room had clearly been prepared with care to mark our anniversary, complete with rose petals on the bed and a lovely couples dessert to greet us. The furniture was functional and well-kept, though a little dated in style, a theme noticeable across parts of the hotel. Still, it didn’t detract from the overall comfort or atmosphere. The shower, set over a bath, was slightly awkward to use because of the space, but manageable.
Around the hotel grounds, the panoramic views over Cork city are stunning. The sunken gardens were beautiful for a short stroll — I can imagine they are even more impressive in full bloom. The quirky artwork and statues dotted around the grounds added a fun and interesting touch.
Accessibility seemed well considered throughout the hotel, with lifts to different floors and ramps connecting most spaces. However, the designated accessible parking bays at the front felt somewhat tight and perhaps better suited as a drop-off zone.
The spa experience was a real highlight. We were greeted by name upon arrival, which created a very welcoming start. Carla provided an excellent Five Element Aroma Massage, both deeply relaxing and effective for the muscle areas I had mentioned beforehand. She also offered great aftercare advice. Despite my initial doubts, the salt room session proved incredibly beneficial — I left after twenty minutes feeling clear-headed and noticeably decongested.
Dinner at the restaurant was another standout moment. Luana, our waitress, went out of her way to make our evening special, acknowledging our celebration and chatting warmly throughout the meal. The live piano music and city views created a wonderfully romantic setting. The oysters were among the freshest we’ve had, and the dessert menu offered some pleasantly unexpected and creative options — a nice touch for a hotel restaurant.
After dinner, we visited the Glasshouse Bar, a stylish and relaxed space separate from the main restaurant bar. The signature cocktails, many made with locally produced spirits, were both inventive and reasonably priced.
Breakfast the next morning continued the high standard, with a good selection of “from the kitchen” dishes — including eggs Benedict, Royale, or Florentine — alongside a well-stocked buffet. Even arriving around 9:45 (with breakfast served until 11), the area never felt particularly crowded.
Overall, The Montenotte combines thoughtful service, beautiful views, and a welcoming atmosphere that make it ideal for a romantic or restorative getaway in Cork. While a few design elements show their age, the warmth of the experience more than makes up for it, and we look forward to returning soon. || Honestly, the best most sincere welcome in a hotel ever from Ken at the door.
The  hotel was just spectacular in every way. The bar area and gardens were exquisite and what a view!!!
We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which had everything we needed to cook our own meals. The layout was great for a family of 4 however I would have liked a larger bed in the master bedroom. The only thing missing in the whole apartment was a mirror beside a plug socket for styling hair...I had to wing it without a mirror which meant I had a questionable hair style for the duration of our stay!
The pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room were fabulous.
We walked and bused it into city centre, bus is 5 min walk away or city centre is a 20 min walk. My advice, walk in and bus it back as its a steep climb up to the hotel.
Get train to Cobh for an afternoon out  or drive to Kinsale 40 mins away, it's beautiful!
We hope to return to this little gem  of a hotel in the future. Thanks so much Montenotte Hoyel! || A wonderful stay at the Montenotte hotel. From the moment you arrive the staff make you feel welcome. The door porter, Kevin - I think is his name was friendly and made you feel right at home. The staff in the hotel are what make the hotel and add to your stay. They really are a credit to the hotel. The rooms are lovely, food in the restaurant is delicious and the breakfast options are extensive. Would highly recommend if you are staying in Cork. || Lovely 4 star hotel with really stunning gardens and a great view over Cork city. We had a very nice  dinner in the restaurant followed by cocktails and live music in the Glasshouse which was sublime. We  recovered the following morning in the gym/pool which is good as hotel gyms go. We had a standard room which was comfortable but the bathroom was a bit on the small side and the wardrobe space was minuscule with too few hangers.
What The Montenotte does best though is customer service. All the staff were well presented, attentive and super engaging, nothing was too much and you felt comfortable asking for what you needed when you needed it. It’s really obvious that management here have invested in staff training and motivation as they are all excellent communicators and all very friendly. There is none of the starchiness you get in some hotels, especially 5 star ones, just a genuine  and friendly welcome. Great resort hotel with a buzzy atmosphere and I highly recommend."

We booked the Wild Atlantic Sauna with Mags (25th October 2025) and it was honestly one of the highlights of our entire trip to Donegal. From the moment we arrived, Mags made everything feel so welcoming and personal – you can tell straight away that this isn’t just a business, it’s something she has poured real passion into.

The setting is breathtaking – a cosy barrel sauna tucked into the dunes, looking straight out onto miles of untouched beach, rolling waves, and the Donegal mountains in the distance. Sitting inside the wood-fired heat, watching the Atlantic through the panoramic window, felt like something out of a travel documentary.

The cold-water dip in the sea between sauna rounds was a total buzz – we had a mixture of seasoned dippers and first-timers in our group, and every single person came out beaming. The contrast between the freezing ocean and the crackling fire inside the sauna is addictive, and somehow you come out feeling lighter, calmer, and completely recharged.

What makes it even better is the little thoughtful touches – the relaxing scent of the timber, the bucket and ladle for löyly, the essential oils and Mags’ warm hospitality. Nothing felt rushed, nothing felt commercial – it felt like being hosted by a friend who knows and loves the area.

We had three generations with us – from swimmers in their 20s to a baby wrapped up in a carrier – and everyone got something out of it. It’s the kind of experience that stays with you long after you leave.

If you’re anywhere near Portnoo, Ardara, or Narin, book this. Don’t hesitate. It’s the purest way to experience the Wild Atlantic – sea, heat, salt air, and total switch-off time.

We’ll 100% be back – see your next time mags 😃 || Highly recommended, an incredible experience on the coast of the chilly Atlantic ocean, that offers a welcomed cold dip from the heat of the Finnish sauna with fantastic views of Dooey Beach. We had to visit twice over the course of our week’s holiday. If you are in this part of the world I can’t recommend the sauna enough. Mags the owner is so lovely and responsive, we’ll see you next time. || Gorgeous sauna with a stunning view of Dooey beach. We booked an hour slot in the sauna and had an amazing time. Mags was lovely and recommended a couple of coffee and food spots for afterwards. Will definitely return. || I’d been wanting to try a seaside sauna and this did not disappoint. Highlight of our trip to Dooey beach, would 100% do it again next time we’re there. The views were incredible, and the whole experience so relaxing. Loved trying the essential oils and Mags was so friendly and accommodating. Can’t recommend highly enough! || An absolute gem! Booked for an hour for my mum's 70th birthday and it was fantastic.
Mags is the best host, and the sauna is incredible. The view from the window is breathtaking, the temperature inside was nice and hot, and it's only a few yards to the sea when you need to cool off 🥶!  Mags provided lots of different essential oils, extra wood, and there were a couple of changing rooms so we could dry off out of the wind.
Will definitely be back again when we're in the area, it's unmissable!"

Awesome experience! || We knew we'd enjoy this, but had no idea HOW MUCH we'd enjoy this. A wonderful end to a day of hiking (and a night of pint-ing previously), leaving us both relaxed and energized. We also played around with the best order of things, which might be worth sharing:

1. 15 min sauna
2. Jump in the ocean
3. Outdoor shower
4. Cold plunge

A special thanks to Cillian, who constantly helped me open the door and even brought me water since I couldn’t get into the cold barrel. He joked he’s not as handsome as Cillian Murphy, but honestly, I think he’s very wrong. Someone should tell him he absolutely deserves an Oscar for his human qualities alone.

This place is pure magic. Highly, highly recommend. || This was so much fun!

What to bring:
1. Drinking water and electrolytes to stay hydrated
2. 2 towels: one for the sauna and another to dry yourself after you are done
3. Slippers or beach shoes

To note:
- Leave your valuables in the car because there are no storage boxes
- Make sure you do not need toilets because the nearest are 5 minutes away || I went for an early morning sauna recently and was delighted with the experience. Two clean and HOT saunas. Plus a cold dunk pool. A water fountain keeps you hydrated. Lovely views while you sweat it out. There is a unisex change room but no toilet. Be warned. A faultless sauna with friendly staff."

When visiting family in Letterkenny, I usually book an overnight to the Shandon but hadn’t intended going to a spa this time. However, I decided last minute to indulge in some pampering but didn’t fancy driving too far and Google threw up The Well House which I had never heard of. We got booked in for a back massage each and I am so glad we did. The spa is just beautiful, the staff are amazing, and the treatments are fabulous. Leah on the desk couldn’t have been more helpful. Shauna provided one of the best hot stone massages I’ve ever had and Colleen, the spa manager, is just so friendly. As someone else posted, The Well is up there with the best and I found it more relaxing than the Monart.
The only minor criticism I have is that the locker configuration is quite close together for getting changed and while there are stools in the changing rooms, a wee bench would be handier to get changed at rather than at the basins and stools. The Spa could also do with a insta tag - I could only tag the Rockhill Estate when I posted!! Full marks for providing shampoo AND conditioner in the showers as well as body wash. The Ishga products are fab.
I will definitely be back for a treat meant and hopefully one of the day spa packages. Will be recommending to my friends! || Most relaxing time spent at The Wellhouse Spa at Rockhill, warmest welcome and spoilt on arrival for an afternoon of bliss, in beautiful surroundings. Would highly recommend, a real treat.  Thanks to Colleen and Melania, and the other lady can’t think of her name,  lovely staff. Will be back soon ⭐️ || A wonderful, peaceful haven in Donegal. Shauna was a wonderful and attentive therapist. The facilities are clean and beautifully designed. I'll definitely be back! || This was the first time of us visiting this spa and we were not disappointed, the booking system online was difficult to navigate but we were able to get this resolved efficiently before our visit. We were greeted by really lovely staff and walked through very carefully our visit and how everything worked, which is helpful for first time visitors. We had the entire facility to ourselves which did make this a very private experience. The staff regularly checked in on us to ensure we were okay which was highly appreciated. The facilities were amazing and plenty to do. The changing areas and entire place was incredibly clean and very high quality. We would definitely visit again. || I will never go to another spa again! Good and all as the others may be, they will not be a patch on this amazing place. I was welcomed by Christine personally and who welcomed me by name...star no.1.  She welcomed me with such warmth. I was shown from the beautiful reception to my dressing room. Stunningly designed with natural wood, stone tiled floors, shower and toilet..all for me! Spacious too. Beautiful robe and flip flops supplied. I changed into my swimsuit, robed, Conor brought me through the first part of the spa. Again, beautifully designed and very organic in it's feel. Soft music playing throughout. Conor showed me into the 'wet' area. A big massage pool in the centre, flanked by a steamroom..gorgeous, a sauna and a thermal suite. Showers and toilet there too. I tried the thermal suite first. It was lovely. Heat on my sore back was so relaxing. I then went to the steam room. Dark with blue pin lights on the ceiling. A small personal shower at every seat. I loved it. I stayed in for about 10 mins, showered and climbed into the ample massage pool. One side hits your neck, shoulders and back. The other side, for lower back and calves. I was in there 3 times! It's fabulous. Through the huge windows you see a garden complete with 2 hot tubs, a yert, seating area and a rain shower for the brave! Which I was! I sat in the 40 degree bubbling hot tub while listening to the breeze in trees and the soft unobtrusive music. I lay on one of comfy loungers outside..it was very mild today! The yert is very special and you can relax there too. I went back inside for another water massage..definitely recommend the power head..brace yourself! It's amazing! I dried off and sat in the relaxation room..still looking out over the lovely garden, and a bar..drank lemon infused water, and swung gently on the seats hanging from the timber beamed ceiling. Now, let me tell you. This is just the pre treatment 90 minutes! By the time Christine came to get me for my ACTUAL treatments, I could have just slept! The lovely thing I found, there was no sense of urgency. There was no rushing. I've been to quite a few spas, there was always a sense of time being of the essence..it probably is, but you don't feel it. On my arrival, I filled in a form. Standard practice, but it was read. Christine brought me to, again, a beautiful, peaceful treatment room. She sat with me and the first thing she said, that she was so sorry for my loss. For the first time on a form I have seen, there is a box for grief. I lost my hubby less than a year ago and it has been especially raw in the past couple of weeks. Christine empathised, was not uncomfortable with my unexpected blubber and just got it! Again, no rushing me. It felt like I owned this spa! Only there for me! I wish! I had booked the Signature Massage and the 24ct facial. All of it was 24ct. The massage was second to none. Firm, never uncomfortable. And again, slow. Never rushed. And the smells..omg. Beautiful. It seemed to last forever...and just when you were sad it was over..it wasn't!! Joy! And then the facial!! Omg...hot towels, massage, oils..it was Heaven. I truly never wanted it to end. When it did, sadly, I was brought a cool lemon infused water and allowed to just relax. I got up and Christine brought me to another beautiful relaxation room..exposed stone, soft lighting, soft music. And bless her, due to having been in water for 90 mins, my robe was damp!! She brought me a dry one, gave me a menu of beautiful herbal teas..and I sat, relaxed further. Now nearly fluid, I poured myself back to my dressing room. Had a wonderful shower changed and was ready for the off...I found Christine and hugged her. This is a very special place, with VERY special people. Empathy is a huge part of being Therapists, and they have it in spades. Rockhill played a huge part in our lives, myself and Pat, and I am sorry it took so long for me to visit The Wellhouse. My advice, go! 5 hours of wonderfulness. Thank you all. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰"

Overall a wonderful experience! I left the spa fully relaxed . || Gemma was amazing at the full body massage. What a brilliant therapist. Excellent at her job. Thanks again || What a fabulous Spa. My treatments were superb, the setting and facilities are fantastic and customer service was unreal. One if the best for sure. Looking forward to getting back soon. || Can't speak highly enough about this spa experience. The thermal suite is small but due to same its quieter and you get to really enjoy your hour pre treatment. Its warm, tranquil & what is there is lovely. No sauna which I did miss but that's a small loss for the overall space. The treatment itself was the star of show. I got the Summer glow package which was divine. Usually I am only relaxing near end of a treatment but my therapist Frances had me switched off & zen in 5 minutes. Her massage technique was perfect & she had my skin looked refreshed post facial. My friend also said the same thing about her therapist & treatment so clearly the excellence is across the board.  Highly, highly recommended!!!! A Deserved 5 stars 🌟 || I visited V Spa on Friday, 7th July, for the first time. From entering the door, I was pampered, I had an exfoliating body treatment and a pedicure. Both were exceptionally good. Rochelle did my pedicure, and I could not recommend this lady highly enough, I never felt a thing as I had an ingrowing nail. My feet never felt this good, I'm a nurse on my feet ++. 10/10 for this spa.

Most staff were genuinely warm and friendly, especially in the Gallery bar.
Our dining experience in the hotel restaurant (apart from very good breakfasts) was very disappointing. The dining room is large, soulless, and functional. The food was tasty -although for 2 small pieces of seabass and some side vegetables - vastly overpriced. My partner's rack of lamb at 48 euro was tasty but portion size was small.
Our bedroom was large and very comfortable and warm. The only downside was the fact that the toilet door was missing and bathwater luke warm!
Checkout was very pleasant but the bill was incorrect. 97 euro had been overcharged to us, but refunded as soon as we discovered the error. However a friend of ours had visited and treated us to 2 wine, and a small beer (paid in cash at the time), which had also been added to our bill. It wasnt  refunded as we couldn't provide proof of payment.
We had really looked forward to a full 5 star experience but felt - at best - it is 4 star || Expectation vs Reality:
Upon arrival to the hotel everything was lovely. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. We made our way to the room which was lovely and spacious and appeared very comfortable. We had lunch and dinner in the bar. It was very nice. When it came to sleeping, the bed had some strange dips in the mattress that were rather large and uncomfortable, but in the grand scheme of things was not nearly as uncomfortable as the levels of dust from the canopy, which I was violently made  aware of after sleeping in the room one night. I woke up struggling to breathe, my throat was sore, my eyes were watery, and my nose was congested. This was due to the copious amounts of dust that lay on the canopy above our bed. The allergic reaction caused by the dust meant a trip to the pharmacy (not once but twice). I could not wait to be out of the room! The room itself appeared very clean. However, the decorative piece above the bed was ultimately holding a lot of dust and was not clean. Quite an awkward thing to clean in all honesty. We frequented the outside for breaks from the room. The antihistamines did not combat the dust, nor did the vapour showers relieve the symptoms caused by the room. Ultimately we contacted front desk about changing the room. We swapped rooms, but still i had inhaled so much dust that it did not help. Sleeping was a nightmare. It felt as if I could not breathe clearly, although much much better than the previous room it did not totally alleviate anything. I spent the night counting down the hours to checkout. We spoke to a very nice lady at the desk she was very apologetic and nice she took the lunch bill off the room and gave us a little box of chocolates. Lough eske seems to pride itself on comfortability, but truthfully I was the most uncomfortable I’ve ever been in a 5 star hotel. I was hoping for a relaxing time but now I am suffering the after affects of a dusty canopy. It’s an incredible shame, because everything else was easily highly rated. For example the food was gorgeous which is why we didn’t feel the need to spend our money elsewhere. Unfortunately I won’t return to this establishment based on this experience, nor shall I recommend it to people. It was quite the expensive disappointing experience. || Lough Eske Castle is a hotel that we will return to time and time again. The service alone makes it feel worth every penny - you're welcomed at the entrance, brought inside and then guided to your room without having to lift a finger to carry your own bags. The staff in both restaurants are lovely, reception staff are always warm and helpful and the cleaning staff greet you along the corridor. Gerard at the front door is particularly friendly!

We've been fortunate enough to be upgraded on a number of occasions, but even the standard courtyard room is cosy and luxurious. Food is fab, cocktails are well-made and the fires being lit in the various seating areas just adds to the overall cosy vibe throughout the hotel. Lovely walks around the lake too and there's always umbrellas to hand if the weather doesn't cooperate. We've been to several 5 star hotels in Ireland and this is the one that we keep coming back to, to the extent that it's becoming a yearly tradition. || Truly 5 star. From the doormen to the bar staff everyone is looking to be of service. Rooms are huge. The spa is lovely. We got the hot tub experience which was super on a winter evening.  Books and pints by the fire in the Red Room.  Not packed in January. Beautiful grounds. Exceeded expectations || Wow, this is a special place! The grounds and castle are stunning in every regard. The room was gigantic and all of the staff were delightful and very welcoming. We went on the half hour horse and cart with Theresa the horse, and highly recommend doing so. It’s incredibly scenic and calming, traversing through the beautiful forest listening to hoofs clip-clopping. Dinner at the restaurant and breakfast the next morning were both excellent, and cocktails at the bar were scrumptious - get the bramble! There is a spa on site as well, and option to book outdoor jacuzzi’s in the gardens. We were very sad to leave such a magical place."

The tutors Chantel and Karen, as well as our coordinator Antoinette, were wonderful. Chantel passed on the passion she has for reflexology right from the start and I enjoyed our Sunday training sessions so much…honestly, they have been life changing for me. She also provided me with so much encouragement as there were times I was giving up. Karen is also very knowledgeable and made the Anatomy and Physiology Training as interesting as could be, breaking it down into parts that made it a lot easier to study. Antoinette also provided encouragement and praise when it was needed, as well as at times being tough, in order to bring us to the required standards.

I’ve also made some amazing friends along the way, which is a fantastic bonus :)

There were a few administrative / communication frustrations throughout the course; however, my overall experience was so positive that I still feel it deserves 5 stars.

I am now a fully qualified reflexology therapist and I can’t wait to get my own business up and running. Thanks to all the wonderful people who helped me get this far!"

Everything was really well done and the sauna felt amazing. Left feeling refreshed and chilled out. Highly recommend and will definitely be back! || amazing experience!! incredibly relaxing environment and super clean facilities as well. great decor too!

first time at a sauna and already ready to come back! || Beautiful sauna experience here! Always clean and friendly people working there. Location is amazing and lovely food court and pub just outside too || I had high expectations based on all the glowing reviews but unfortunately, my experience didn’t quite match the hype. Don’t get me wrong, the female staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, creating a great first impression and making you want to return. However, whoever is managing the overall operations needs to reassess the maximum capacity.

With nine people crammed into a hot sauna, it felt overcrowded and uncomfortable. Reducing the limit to seven would make a significant difference. The decor and rustic nature-inspired ambiance were well done, but the experience was dampened by the noise level. In the pod we chose, a group was talking loudly, laughing, and shouting which wasn’t the relaxing atmosphere I had hoped for, especially for my first sauna experience (in Ireland).

To make matters worse, when two people left for the plunge baths, seating naturally shifted due to the tight space. When they returned, one of them expected his original spot to still be available and tried to squeeze in, making another guest visibly uncomfortable to the point that she got up and left. His reaction was ‘I didn’t do anything’. 🚩🚩🚩🚩 This situation only highlighted the issue with the overcrowding in these pods.

My partner enjoyed it more once the crowd thinned out after this incident - but for me, it was enough to put me off returning. I did notice they offer Silent Nights and Ladies’ Nights, and I imagine a Silent Night would be a much better option for those seeking a peaceful experience. A safety factor that could be considered in the future are safety toggles, wrapped around the wrist when pressed it alerts the staff to check the pod out. ⚠️ something to ponder on of course. || Always a great experience here. Sauna is nice and hot, plunge is nice and cold. Friendly helpful staff. The barrel sauna has a high enough ceiling that the heat is pleasant. Stop for a coffee and a treat in Pan Eile in the courtyard when you are done. Rafa will look after you."

All the staff were so helpful, was my first time there so was really nice of them to take the time to show us around. Will definitely be back again || Stopped by for some coffee and treats. Did not try the sauna. Service was excellent and coffee was delicious. The croissant was a ok, probably would try something different next time. Lovely location in a nice day! || 31st Finnish sauna review. These saunas are both great. Temperature was a minimum of 90c entire time, ranging up to 110c. Wood fired was 110c down to 90c, electric was a flat 105c. Humidity was 10% in both.

IMO the ash pan in the wood fired stove was kept open way too long and a bunch of the heat was being lost as the timber was being burnt through too often, leading to inconsistency.

Feedback to help with the culture; tell people when they attend to go in/out quickly and don’t keep the door open. Too many people didn’t seem to know about the importance of the door lot of good heat was lost.

The bucket and ladle in the electric sauna could/should be upgraded from plastic to wooden - hot plastics are bad.

The bench height in the electric sauna was perfect, law of löyly maintained. Also the first time seeing the rounded rocks in person. They do give off a smoother löyly, which is lovely. That combination has that experience being one of the most perfect saunas I’ve visited. With the rocks hot as they were the lämpömassa was on point, unlike others. This was a sauna I didn’t want to leave. The wood fired sauna’s temperature was variable based on how the fire was being fed, combined with the ash pan being open and it was a bit more hit and miss. Combined that with sitting a bit lower (law of löyly not observed) and it didn’t quite pack the same punch. Still a good experience, but not next level like the electric. The electric was the star of the show! Both heaters were Harvia heaters so quality.

The cold plunges were spot on, the coldest bath felt close to 0c and there was around 4-5 other baths with different temperatures.

Would love a warm shower to heat up afterwards before heading out, but that doesn’t take away from the experience. Will be back when next in Dublin. Thank you!"

However, the plunge pool area is limited, only three baths, which isn't sufficient when there are 6 to 8 people.

Welcome to Fad Saoil, the sauna home of BMO running club! I was introduced to the sauna because I signed up for the run club’s long run series (and recovery thereafter) in preparation for the Dublin Marathon 2025.

So overall, Fad Saoil is pretty decent for a sauna place. They have 2 hot boxes (1 normal and 1 for silent sauna), 3 cold plunge tub with 3 different temperatures, shower area, changing rooms and a toilet. Fad Saoil can accommodate 16 pax per time slot.

I would say that it is a good value for money both for sauna members and non-members and they have packages for frequent visitors.

Staffs are so nice and accommodating but I won’t suggest to do walk-ins though as Fad Saoil gets busy too. Make sure you book online before visiting. 😂

Definitely visiting again!🙂 || Hands down the best sauna experience I’ve had in Dublin, I was introduced to the place by the BMO running club and have since became a regular both for recovery after runs and just to relax.

The staff is amazing and the vibe is so friendly and welcoming that it feels like someone’s living room. The location is ideal as well when it’s easy to get to (and also accessible to go for a run before your session).

I’m from Finland and grew up going to the sauna several times a week. Since moving to Dublin almost four years ago the thing I miss most has been a proper sauna - with the proper heat, cold plunge and atmosphere to go with it. So glad I finally found this place! || Small, but good setup & clean. 2 saunas on site & 3 cold plunges. This was my first time going there & it didn’t disappoint. There are numerous changing booths but no lockers for your belongings, only shelves to store them on. Would be great to see them get some lockers there for safe storage down the line. Picked up a sauna hat from them for 15 quid on the way out which I will be using on my next visit! || Cute little ""grotto"" tucked in the hustling and bustling of Rathmines.

The saunas are fantastic, they heat up very quick, especially the silent sauna, which you can essentially burn your ears off if you so choose to.

the plunge pool or plunge pods or whatever you want to call them are also really nice, although I wouldn't mind having a larger communal plunge so more people could join.

overall this is a great concept and honestly a fantastic setup that you can have great meetups or experiences with your friends and co-workers or whatever!

also if you can bring your own drinks so that's pretty cool.

I would absolutely go here again, and definitely recommend any of their locations.
apparently their greystones location has a scenery to die for, so I will be checking that out due to my great experience here!

thanks again!"

And the cherry on top: every two hours they host different sauna rituals, which makes the experience even more special and immersive. We absolutely loved it.

Cannot recommend highly enough. Keep up the good work lads || Had an amazing experience at Hot Box Sauna, Boland Mills. The sauna ritual with Otis was the highlight — expertly guided, calming, and incredibly restorative. Otis creates such a welcoming, focused atmosphere and clearly knows his craft.

Brilliant value for money for the quality of the experience. Highly recommend and will definitely be back 🔥🧖‍♀️ || An absolutely brilliant experience. Special mention to Otis and Maria.

The cold plunge? It’s like being slapped in the face by a frozen salmon. You jump in, forget your own name, and come out feeling like you’ve been baptised by the Holy Spirit himself.

Fair play, though — it works wonders!
The sauna? Always roasting — hotter than a Dublin bus in July, I swear. Sit in there for five minutes and you’ll be sweating out sins you didn’t even know you had.

Dan, the man himself — sound as a pound. Always up for a chat, keeps the place spotless, and makes everyone feel welcome.

You can tell there’s grá (that’s “love” in Irish!) in every corner of the place.
Honestly, Blaze is a little slice of wellness heaven right here in Clonsilla. Whether you’re in for the health benefits or just trying to survive the ice bath without screaming — you’ll leave feeling like a new person.

Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique and revitalizing wellness experience! || I would love to give this place a 5 star but I cant.
It really is a little oasis and they have set it up wonderfully, and it looks great in every aspect BUT they need to work on the temperatures of their sauna's. The two wood fired saunas were over 120 degrees when i went in, and you could barely breathe. So then I tried the electric ones, and one was only 40 degrees, and the other was a perfect 80 degrees but when I tried to sit down the wood was so hot it burnt me. I dont know why, I think they may have used the wrong wood in this sauna? Because ive never experienced that before, and ive been to a lot of saunas. I even tried with my towel, but wherever I touched the wood it was like seriously burning so I couldn't relax. I told the staff but they didnt seem to care, and just offered me a towel. Which made me wonder why I'd been using my towel and hadn't been offered one from the start if they had towels for customers.
I ended up going back to the wood fired one, leaving the door open till the temperature came back down below 100 and this was quite nice, but overall not the relaxing experience you want from a sauna.
The place looks fantastic and the ice baths are an awesome touch, and by all accounts the place should have been packed, yet there were maybe 2 other people here, which begs the question why?
Also in the whole hour or longer I was in the sauna (which started out at over 120 degrees) the staff did not check or do a single round to see if people were ok? There were two of them just sitting there chatting and I think maybe their time would have been spent better checking on the saunas and ensuring the temperatures were kept within a certain range.
The idea is great, the place itself is great and you've almost got an amazing experience, but temperature is so important in a sauna, and you need to work on yours a bit. If you fix that, you'll have a wonderful place ✨️
Also do not like the plastic water bottles. If you're going to operate a sauna a water bottle refill station is a non negotiable! || So pleased to have this gem of a spot so local to us. Impressive set-up of an array of wood-fired and electric sauna options, different temp. cold plunges and crucially proper shower facilities for after. 10/10.

The lake is very refreshing for a dip.

Review edit July2025: the experience you get really depends on who is working, I went last week at 7pm and when I got in the fire was out and I had to ask the person working to relight it. 20 minutes of the 1 hour session spent heating the sauna up from scratch. Probably won’t use it as much as it is unreliable compared to other local saunas where the fires are tended to frequently. || I loved my time down at the Sauna Snug.

There just something about the Sauna Snug that works I'm sure when you go down and try it you'll know what I mean.
I've been to other Sauna places where you can feel how wellness and saunas are being used in Ireland to replace traditional social settings, you can feel how they're set up to make money, and you feel rushed.

With the Himalayan salt sauna, the hydrotherapy bath, the endless pool for laps in place, and the high-quality restaurant, this is the best place to spend six hours on your last day visiting Ireland. End your visit with a cocktail on the complex roof with the best outdoor view in Dublin. I must return to this place again, or I will be unsatisfied with my existence on this planet. || Pure relaxation!! the spa package we got which included lunch really hit home! The massage was out of this world along with the cocktails! The food was sublime! Great way to spend a wedding anniversary. And the heated pool was great to chill out and have a chat about where the year has gone!"

To our horror we realised that there is a large cavity between the floor and wall (see pictures below) - a huge health & safety risk. The cavity was around 5cm wide in parts so we flashed a light and were unable to see the earbud. I spoke to Amy at the reception who said that she would look with a rubbish picker and offered nothing else. She also explained that this happened already with a customer who dropped their keys but “the guys” were able to get them. I stated my concern for the health & safety cavity in the floor directly under the ladies changing benches to which she said “we’re not open that long and we’ve already fixed the roof and that it’s up to the guy who owns the building not the enterprise renting?” I replied that I didn’t think it was good enough, she  offered no compensation or apology.  A half an hour later she found us in the sauna while she was adding blocks to the fire, and said she tried but couldn’t see anything and “taking the floor boards up would be tricky” I asked if that was an option she said no. . So I asked for a pair of gloves to search myself her response was her arms/ hands were too lanky but someone like my with smaller hands would be better for the job”, her solution was that we could stay in the sauna a bit longer? Allowing a customer to even go near the cavity filled with sharp nails, dirty socks is a health violation in itself. We entered the changing room about 10 mins later, & we saw Amy had left the picker there for us to use to no avail.  I had to then with my friends assistance to lay on the floor searching with a plastic bag over my hand, I wasn’t able to search for long due to the rusty nails sticking outwards. We decided is wasn’t worth searching for given the dirt. My friend had hung her coat and bottoms on opposite coat hangers, which were soaked right through - so the roof repair clearly wasn’t up to par. As we left, I asked Amy to process a refund for today, her face squirmed in disbelief. I said it’s a health & safety risk, you’ve not offered up any compensation, and showed her the coat that was completely soaked through on the hook (see in picture). Her response was sharp, “that’s what the lockers are there for when it’s raining” I said you don’t have a sign up stating that you have a leaky roof under both the areas where my friend hung her clothes? Same with the floor there should be a sign to be careful for the gap. She reminded us that they aren’t open that long, to which I said the hot box group have been running for a long time & we’ve been loyal customers and secondly, this issue has happened in the past so why haven’t they sorted the cavity from a health and safety point of view. I asked for her name & asked her to confirm that she didn’t think my refund request was fair due to the shock on her face. She said she’d be happy for me to add all of my concerns into a Google review instead. || Everything was perfect, staff is delightful and the place is stunning! I am leaving 4 stars only because there is no toilet available but: will definitely be back :D lovely. || 43rd Finnish sauna review: location is simply stunning. 2 wood fired sauna on the Irish coast. Each sauna was around 98c. 2 level of benches. Harvia stoves. The stove is well sized for the sauna, allowing 8 or so people per sauna. The löyly is soft, but based on the small sauna size doesn’t mess around either. The ladle was unique; allowing a good scoop of water but allowed  gradual stream into the rocks, helping with the soft feeling. The team kept the stove well fed throughout the session. Very short walk to the ocean. Great location, great experience. || The Hot Box Sauna in Killiney is an absolute must when visiting the area. It’s a truly unique and refreshing experience. The setting is spectacular, with panoramic views of the coastline that make it feel extra special. The sauna itself is beautifully maintained, and the option to cool off with a sea swim or outdoor shower is invigorating. A special shout out to Amy and Otis, whose warm hospitality make the experience even more enjoyable. They are attentive, welcoming, and clearly passionate about ensuring everyone has a memorable visit. Highly recommended! || We visited for the first time this week. It was so great. From the moment we arrived Otis was a great host, made us feel very welcome. The location is perfect, the ocean crashing outside the large sauna window helps to draw you into a state of relaxation and reflection. We will definitely be back. Thanks Otis!"

The room also includes a sauna & steam room. Decor is gorgeous & place is immaculately clean & maintained. Highly recommended! || We booked a “Unique Spa Day” in Dublin and it was by far the worst spa experience we have ever had. We paid over €300, and almost nothing worked.

The electricity was broken, the jacuzzi was not working, and the sauna was out of order. A spa without a functioning jacuzzi or sauna is simply unacceptable. The facilities were poorly maintained and the whole place felt chaotic and unprofessional.

To make matters worse, staff tried to charge us extra money on top of what we had already paid — despite the fact that the advertised services were not even available. There was no proper apology, no real attempt to fix the situation, and no compensation offered.

This was not relaxing, not luxurious, and absolutely not worth the money. It felt like a complete waste of time and honestly like a rip-off.

Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place. Save your money and your nerves. || The atmosphere was warm, clean, and truly relaxing, exactly what I needed. The service was exceptional, with clear communication, great care, and a calming energy that makes you disconnect from the outside world.

I went on one of the Thursday night and Friday night, staff were welcoming and helpful, there were lads in all ages and shapes.

I telephoned this morning to find out when the remodelling would finish. Phone rang out 23 times (set to redial) without being answered. Management and staff show no regard for regular customers. Dublin needs a professionally run sauna, not this shambles. || I'm considering visiting this weekend but very concerned about the reviews I have read.

As a global blogger, I'm interested to see if this established brand lives up to its reputation || Review – The Boilerhouse Dublin
I would like to raise a concern regarding the conduct of a staff member named Filip (identifiable by tattoos).
During my visit, his behaviour towards customers was unprofessional, impolite, and lacked basic respect. While on duty, he appeared distracted and more focused on socialising for personal enjoyment rather than carrying out his assigned responsibilities. This behaviour created an unprofessional atmosphere and negatively affected the overall customer experience.
Customer-facing staff should maintain a high standard of professionalism at all times. Unfortunately, this standard was not met on this occasion."

Aquasun a few months ago. I dealt with Maria in the showrooms and she was a pleasure to deal with. Post install I had a couple of minor issues. Once I informed Aquasun of these , they were,  on both occasions resolved promptly and with the highest level of customer care. The post sale customer care that Aquasun provide is exceptional and the professionalism of their staff is a credit to them all. In a time where great customer service is not always a given Aquasun are certainly a fantastic example on how it should be done. Well done Aquasun! || First encountered Aquasun at a show in the RDS years ago.  I was impressed with their professional knowledge and non pushy sales approach.  I said if I was going to buy a tub I'd call in.  So this year we did exactly that.  Ronan, our sales guy, spent plenty of time with us.  He showed us everything they had in stock and explained all the pros and cons of each tub.  Finally we settled on a Hotspring Flair.  In these strange times delivery, like everything else was uncertain, but Ronan said end of July was realistic.  The tub arrived first week in August, so that's pretty much spot on.  The installers came and they had a difficult task getting the tub to its final place in the garden, but they did it efficiently and quickly with absolutely no damage to the decking, not even a tiny scratch.  One of the guys stayed behind and commissioned it and a day later we were using the tub.  I've since been back into the store for some top up chems and Debbie spent more time with ironing out a few small water quality questioned I had.  I'd highly recommend Aquasun if you're in the market for a tub or pool. || We were looking for an outdoor sauna suitable for our back garden. Nathan was great and showed us loads of different ones but we fell in love with the barrel sauna and chose to go with the bigger 3.5m barrel sauna. It only took about 10 weeks to arrive...from Lithuania 🇱🇹..and delivery and installation was superb. The guys were brilliant and didn't mind us filming everything. It was so cool to see it being put together.  Our electrician came a few days later and sorted that out for us and we were up and running that evening.  Its so easy to operate and so relaxing. The bigger size was worth it as it meant we had the changing room 1st so on wet or cold nights we could pop from that to the sauna room and back without coming outside. A beer..a glass of wine...and some relaxing music...and a good hot sweat...heaven. Thanks a million to Nathan and Debbie and all the gang. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like their own private garden spa. 🥰 || Great people to deal with. They do what they say and do it when they say they'll do it. Their after sales is exceptional... I sent an email with a problem with one of the clasps on my hot tub cover - they replied by return. I sent a follow up email, and they responded almost immediately. At 8.15 the following morning, a solution to the problem was delivered to my front door! Now that's service. I have no hesitation in recommending them.
PS. The hot tub is great too!

TIGH’N ALLUIS is not just a sweat house it is an experience. A perfect blend of nature luxury calm and care.

The whole experience was diabolical to say the least. We could list off at least 20-30 points of issues (no exaggeration) the experience was that bad we couldn’t leave with anything being unsaid.
We arrived to a reception that was unwelcoming (staff standing behind a desk talking amongst themselves) and two maintenance men on a ladder fixing the ceiling.
We arrived in the relaxation room where we chatted before our treatments. Three young male therapists walked in to collect us(we were never asked upon booking nor asked upon check in if we were ok with a male therapist) it is a standard that this is asked. They even confirmed this later that evening during our complaint.
The staff had only arrived in Dublin one month ago. This was apparent as there was clearly no training carried out and if there was there was no supervision of a senior staff member to confirm that they were competent to carry out the treatments. The treatments we had were not as described in the brochure. The massages were mediocre and the staff were clearly not trained in facials, it was a series of applying creams then removing with dry cotton pads, at one point it felt that the fluff was coming off the pads and left on face, my therapist kept alternating between face/shoulders it was so inconsistent. Any facial I had before left the shoulder massage until the end of the treatment, I am almost certain my therapist was on his phone at the beginning and mid treatment probably to check the steps of what he was doing. Our mascara was still on after the facial had ended and face felt sticky and unwashed. The product was not applied to our décolletage.
My mother had to stop the therapist half way because it was obvious that he was not trained. Everything about the facial was wrong, having had many facials across many spas in many countries you are aware of the common steps regardless of what brand or products are used and she just knew this was not right. She called for a manager, a female therapist came to discuss what was wrong. No solution was offered.During this time my sister was having her massage treatment which she left feeling extremely uncomfortable due to the consistent conversation/questioning by her therapist. Questions such as ‘what music do you like’, ‘have you been to Japan’, ‘where he was brought up and holidayed with his parents’ completely unrelated to the treatment. Upon leaving the treatment she was met by the senior therapist on duty in the treatment corridor who informed her she would be charged 50% cancellation fee as she was not having a facial. This was something we informed the therapist at the beginning and were told that was no problem.  This was completely in appropriate timing and extremely pressurising.
Upon returning to the relaxation room we learnt of each others experience and the female therapist that had been dealing with my mother came to discuss the matter with us, we then explained again what happened. After 20minutes the male senior therapist came to the relaxation room to listen to our complaint. We should not have had to repeat ourselves a second time (a third time for my mother)
All we were told was that they will have to speak to a manager but that they may not be able to get in contact with one.
Upon leaving the spa one hour after the original complaint the therapist on the reception took out her mobile and said ‘oh your leaving, I just have to call someone’. At this point we were leaving and not waiting for a solution, I had informed the therapist that I would accept a call that evening if there was someone on duty if not then I would expect a call the following morning. I received an email at 8pm that evening from the receptionist to apologise again and that the spa director Margaret McCallum would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the matter on Wednesday.  I am still awaiting a response and it’s Friday!! || I was given a gift card of a Luxury Spa massage and facial treatment. It was wonderful!

I was then introduced to my masseuse, a friendly, professional Thai lady who spent 90 mins. on my massage and facial.
The heated massage table, the use of aroma therapy oils and the relaxing music enhanced the whole experience.
After a shower, sauna and a dip in the pool I snuggled up in my cosy dressing gown and slippers and relaxed in the private lounge room overlooking St. Stephens green and read from a choice of glossy magazines while I drank a cranberry juice and later a sweet berry tea. Each person has their own couch with a wrap around silk headboard for added luxury and privacy.
I can totally recommend this luxury spa experience. See my photos of the areas I have described. Enjoy! || My son treated me to a spa day which cost 335 euro in total.
Changing into my robe I was given a pair of flip flops. One a size 5 approx and one poss a size 8. The full body massage was reasonable but not memorable. The facial was a series of creams applied. Creams removed. Creams applied… Perhaps 4/5 times. I’m not sure she knew what she was doing. Marianna the tattooed masseuse then moved on to my head massage. Very poor show. She proceeded to endlessly tangle my hair and no real massage technique.
She then showed me to the relaxation room with a few other ladies.
It was only when I went to the toilet that I saw what state I was in, in the mirror. I had large panda eyes where my eyemakeup had not been removed properly and my hair was an outageous bouffant of a birds nest. I felt humiliated and embarassed. This spa is at best a 2 star set up. The Shellbourne would be best to close it down rather than damage the hotels reputation further by associating with it. || I may have booked the wrong treatment, but I wanted to share my understanding of what a pedicure typically includes. For me, a pedicure is not just about having polished nails, but about achieving healthy, well-groomed feet — free of corns, excess cuticles, and other issues.

In my case, the treatment mainly included nail polishing and some moisturizing. One of the nails ended up crooked, which I didn’t notice during the procedure as I trusted the specialist to shape the nails correctly without my oversight.

I believe a pedicure should go beyond cosmetic care and include proper attention to foot health. It would have been helpful to know the scope of the treatment in advance to ensure expectations were aligned. || I had the pleasure of having a facial with my best friend on Tuesday.

The staff in the shelbourne are so professional 👏 they made sure our visit was very luxurious. We had the use of all the spa facilities which we thoroughly enjoyed.

Irmak carried out the most beautiful relaxing uplifting facial🥰using amazing products. I felt as if I was walking on air for the day.

The wonderful staff then proceeded to introduce us to a beautiful quiet room to relax  where they served us beautiful fruit and champagne.
I would highly recommend a visit.
A huge thank you to all the staff ."

NebulaSpa - Home Saunas | Jacuzzis | Freestanding Bathtubs (ONLINE STORE),ChIJpWzbuMkRZ0gRVKMM65F3RKw,"14-4 Shrewsbury Rd, Sandymount, Dublin, D04 C2C8, Ireland",Dublin,53.3231678,-6.2230915,https://nebulaspa.eu/,,4.9,32.0,AcnlKN3xZZDXT7KSr1hgoLdq7uRh89J8p8M1gZ4gB97EnzktsD-soP4J7IK3rH1prf5xhjtxIJUg0g_gbxNP822qrAvQVZg5X3g8OnI7fMrdfvpyH9x1EaSO7YeBcmslWHO8nInxsdNvWUarzHqWJPWtGwAj71P8o8JwTQSuZo9-QyLXIbgqulbL7-dlopzYDHgyf4xFGvwFbk4S7DN3a-Mz1ac9OvJWVGwALYXvwMn2PkpFaiCeFWfqaCbHknzbG4og-qIXjEo4MoTMOQ9RPwMQ3vii7dL4_mxFOtwAOByFa9D-5g,,,"Great product and works perfectly for a great price but note review as follows;

After extensive research online and going into showrooms around Dublin (Ireland), I decided to order from Nebula Spa as the price was by far the best but it didnt not include assemply/installation which local companies could. The order was delayed and took a bit longer to arrive as I ordered when Trump announced his tarriffs and the logistics market when into meltdown. It only resulted in a two week delay which I was fine with but Nebula Spa sent me some gifts in the meantime which was a very nice touch.

I ordered the Nordic Bliss 2 (2 person) Traditional Electric Sauna and it came in flat back packaging which were heavy to move upon delivery. It took me around half a day to assemble the sauna myself and it wouldnt be feasible to assemble by someone without some strength as the parts are big and heavy. The instructions were not very clear so it took a bit longer but I managed to figure it out as there were no screws or drilling involved, just assembly of the various large sauna component parts.

Once fully assembled, I noticed the heater needs an electrician to install. This was were I came into difficulty as it was hard to find an electrician to take on the job or one that knew how to hardwire a sauna heater. The heater has to be connected directly into fuse box so you cannot do it yourself, unless you're an electrician. Eventually I got an electrician in and he found the instructions difficult to read and follow so it was a more difficult job than anticipated.

The installation was the hard part and I would probably have considered ordering an infrared sauna as this is plugged into socket so easy installation. The electrician cost was not cheap and it was a full days work given the sauna was not set up in the house so it added onto the price of the sauna itself.

Regardless, the sauna is working perfectly now and I'm very happy with the product, just be warned that the Traditional/Electric sauna needs work and a strong person to assemble and also an electrician to hook up the sauna heater which incurs an additional cost. || It would be nice if they had a phone service but their email service is really good. Ordered the Crystal Sauna and waited just over a week and received an additional gift. It’s nice the way delivery is free || Absolutely Brilliant customer service, I’ve been looking to purchase a jacuzzi for the summer and I couldn’t have found a better place to do it. The employee gave me the best choices to pick from to satisfy my needs. He was also very generous with the deal that he has given me and the delivery service was effortless. Will definitely be recommending to my friends. Perfect in time for the warmer season! || At first I was sceptical the way it's an online store and I thought they are realitvely new on the market. I was worried about the delivery and quality of the bathtub and sauna I ordered not being best quality as advertised. However I was very nicely surprised as the sauna's and the bathtub's build quality was exceptionally good and I received both in less than two weeks after ordering, also I received a little surprise gift from the company. So overall I am very happy with my experience with Nebulaspa and most likely will buy a hot tub soon. || I recently had the pleasure of shopping at Nebula Spa and I couldn't be more satisfied with the experience. The website is user-friendly, offering a wide range of high-quality bathtubs and jacuzzis to suit every need and budget. Customer service was exceptional, providing prompt and knowledgeable responses to my queries."

Tea on arrival is an extra touch to add to experience and the essential oil change every 15 minutes was amazing. The lady working there was absolutely lovely and nice to deal with. Will definitely return and recommend to friends. || Had a lovely experience last week doing the 1 hour sauna and ice bath session at Align Wellness. From the moment we arrived, Ayeesha was very friendly providing us with hot tea & information about the sauna and ice baths. The venue is very clean and calming and I will definitely go back when travelling back to Dublin again for a visit. || This sauna delivers a near-perfect, impeccably clean, and well-kept experience that’s easily 5-star worthy in facilities and service. Will definitely come back. Hot tea greets you on arrival for a warm welcome, and the oil infusions in the sauna create a luxurious, aromatic highlight. The attendant stands out as amazing.

Dropping to 4 stars because there’s no clear signage or reservation notes enforcing silence or minimal voices - crucial for true relaxation, disconnection and recharging in a sauna. It’s often ruined by pairs of gals besties gossiping loudly like it’s Sunday brunch, filling the space with chatter for the entire hour and it had me leaving with a headache. Signs stating “keep silence” or low volume would help with guest behaviour without blaming the business. || Align is like nowhere I've been before. The whole experience of the guided sauna session with Katie was absolutely magical. Every little detail is thought of, from the cup of tea to the lighting in the sauna, the essential oils, the ice. The facilities are just incredible. I will definitely be back!"

The staff were genuinely friendly, and we were shown to a private suite, which immediately set the tone for a relaxing experience.

The Swedish oil massage was exceptional—deeply relaxing and expertly done. We also made full use of the sauna and the Tranquility Room, which was especially calming with its gentle, ASMR-like waterfalls. A glass of prosecco, along with soothing tea, added a thoughtful touch.

The entire experience felt unhurried and well worth it. I would highly recommend this spa and will absolutely be returning. || I had the Pause Ritual at Buff Day Spa and it genuinely exceeded my expectations. I loved every minute and left the spa glowing — the results were visible straight away. Maria, the senior therapist, has truly magical hands and made the whole experience so relaxing and personalised.

She recommended the Dermalogica NeuroTouch Symmetry Serum afterwards, and even though it’s on the pricier side, it’s packed with advanced ingredients and you only need a tiny amount. It really helped maintain the lifted, smoother, more balanced look in the days after my treatment.

I’ll definitely be returning and purchasing the serum. Highly recommend! || A calm oasis amidst the craziness of Dublin, perfect for treating yourself!

If you like medium to firm massage pressure, I can wholeheartedly recommend Brooke and Nico - they are exceptional. Brooke also does really nice facials and so does Florentina! But honestly, all their staff is good, so you'll have a good experience no matter what!"

Urban Recovery Sauna is an absolute gem for anyone serious about recovery. I’m a big lover of spas and saunas, and this place is simply perfect.

If you like real heat that gets deep into your bones and helps your body properly recover after training, this is the place to go. I’ve been training here for a while, and finishing a session with the sauna has become a must for me.

It’s the best way to relax, reset, and prepare both physically and mentally for the next day. Top-quality experience every time.

The saunas are spacious, feature double doors and multi-level seating, and there are also two large hot tubs. The staff consistently clean and monitor the hot tubs, cold plunges, and saunas, which really shows. There’s also a large parking lot right in front, so parking is never an issue. || Good saunas and hot tub, but changing facilities are poor: no lockers, no hot shower, no toilet, nowhere to fill a water bottle and the plunge pools felt unclean. Not very pleasant.

Reply to owner response: The review was an honest reflection of our experience. The intention was to make other customers aware, as we would have appreciated this information before our visit.

The showers and toilet in the adjacent gym being open for use for sauna users - were absolutely not mentioned to us at sign‑in. We were told that one of the three cold plunges had been emptied that day; the other two were, unfortunately, not pleasant to use.

I also didn’t mention that two lads were using the facilities in their boxers. That may not bother some people, but it wasn’t pleasant for us.

As noted in my review, the saunas and hot tubs themselves are good. I appreciate you’re running a business and not all customers will care about the points I raised—but some will, which is why I felt the review was worth posting. It wasn’t intended to cause damage, just to inform.

Good luck with it."

We lived in Sandycove and I was always here from the start but moved away for 2 years and we are back in the area for good and what can I say the transformation for the greater good not that is wasn’t good, loved how is changes all the time!!

Greeted by a lovely girl working tonight made feel so welcome.

Drinks 10/10

Price 100/10 (pints €5, glass of lovely Rioja €7.50) that’s unreal..

Food 10/10

This place is genuinely unreal and to top it all off they have sauna’s…

Highly recommend to all.

Super dog friendly. || 🔥 Superb spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch/coffee. Went there post 40 foot swimming (and Sauna) and it seems to be the place to go after these types of activity. They also have a sauna and ice bath tank on site (but we didn't go there, as it's not right next to the sea.)

Otherwise, fast service, delicious food, good vibes, friendly&happy people all around. Will definitely come back. Oh and they have Austrian Stiegl beer, which is surprising but definitely a plus ⭐ || I ordered a takeaway açaí bowl and noticed a long black hair in it when I opened it. I was already away from the shop, so I couldn’t go back. Considering the price, this was quite disappointing. I hope hygiene standards improve. || Lovely café. Chill vibes!
Fresh smoothies and food.
Different sitting areas.
Place and pay for food, collect food when buzzer goes off.
We had a combo: smoothie (berries, banana, yoghurt, seeds), chocolate brownie, rocky road, acai bowl. Very good 👍🏼
Background music to enjoy. || Went here for the first time today and will definitely be back to try other things on the menu and the sauna.

The place is absolutely lovely, didn’t have a coffee there unfortunately but the cheese toasties were lovely.

Service was great too, quick turnaround for the sandwich.

Great vibe about the place too."

I had a very pleasant experience at Anantara Spa in Dublin, visiting with my daughter.

The staff were warm, professional and attentive. We were welcomed right on time at 2:15 pm — always appreciated when you value good organisation.The spa facilities are beautiful: jacuzzi, saunas, calm atmosphere and a truly relaxing massage. The relaxation room afterwards was the perfect finishing touch. Also, special mention to the gentleman at reception for his excellent service.

Just one small note from a very relaxed (but attentive) guest 😊
I had booked a one-hour massage, but because we were kindly invited to use the bathroom and allowed to take a few videos before starting, the massage itself lasted around 40 minutes, finishing exactly at 3:15 pm. Had I known, I would have saved those “pre-spa rituals” for later — timing matters when you want to enjoy every minute.

Overall, a beautiful spa, skilled professionals and a very enjoyable experience.
Highly recommended — just keep the timing in mind to make the most of it ✨ || I love coming here, especially due to Efi, the massage therapist. She is truly amazing! I keep coming back cause her massage is both relaxing and very effective, she works my muscles really well and I always leave feeling completely refreshed and moving better due to less tension in my muscles. She is also great with adjusting to my individual needs especially cause I have had some past injuries, she is very attentive and she always knows what to do. If you want to truly relax, book a session with her! The facilities are also great and really help before and after a session to fully unwind and relax || Booked this hotel for the misfits event, it is expensive but worth every penny!

Our room was huge, modern but classy. The mattress, Pillows, Sheets were incredible one of the best nights sleep I’ve had in ages.

We visited the spa on multiple occasions, sauna was great, steam room was great, pool is huge! Hot tub could do with some improvements as the jets were quite weak especially around the back area but other than that honestly 9/10. If you’re after a dark moody spa where you can really just relax this is the spa for you!

Treatment! We decided to book in for a couples massage the 30/30, 30mins Back.. 30 mins Facial, and it was incredible, genuinely one of the best massages I’ve ever had! And I wasn’t pressured into buying products after, they took us to a relaxation room with electric beds that are to die for! Oh and I forgot to mention the massage bed was heated!

Everything included 10/10 recommend this spa if you want that luxury get away feeling! || Update:
After complaining to the spa, the manager was prompt and arranged an alternate massage with their most skilled therapist. Thank you :)
———————————————————————-I'm incredibly disappointed with the massage I received. For 200 EUR, I expected a far more professional and skilled experience. The therapist seemed utterly inexperienced, lacking any knowledge of pressure points or massage techniques. The entire session felt like my body was simply being rubbed with oil. There was no rhythm, no flow, and the pressure was uneven on both sides of my body.

The back massage was almost non-existent, and the hot stones were literally jammed into my neck. The head massage was the worst part - it felt more like scratching than an actual massage. My scalp started burning after 20 minutes, forcing me to ask her to stop. Despite my attempts to provide feedback, the therapist seemed unable to adjust her technique.

I have never had to stop a massage halfway through before, but this experience was so subpar that I had no choice. I strongly advise against booking a massage with this therapist. || Perfect, the complex is very beautiful and pleasant, just like the staff. Only a few minor issues, such as a jacuzzi button that no longer works, for example."

The area has a rustic and spartan style - the parking is located behind some containers - but this adds to the authentic charm of the place. Don't expect luxury, but everything you need is there: electricity and water are available, and the restrooms, though chemical toilets, are functional.

What makes this place special are the extra services: the possibility to use the sauna and take seaweed baths is a real plus, along with the small bar where you can relax. The surrounding panorama is truly splendid and worth the visit alone.

The value for money is excellent: 25 euros per night is really affordable considering the prices of other campsites in the area. For those looking for an authentic experience, essential services, and great scenery without breaking the bank, this place is perfect.

It enabled the body to detoxify through the pressure given from the tips of your toes and fingers right through the body. .
This weekend I decided to try the Floatation tank for the first time, what can I say other than I was blown away by the experience. I didn't have great expectations of the treatment, but after this, I will be floating every chance I get. It was the most relaxing thing I have every experienced.

The location is unmatched. If you like to take a genuine cold-plunge (and not a cold ‘walk-out-into-the-water’) - you can literally step out of the sauna and jump into 8-feet of lake water.

There’s also a ladder (with nice wide steps that don’t hurt your feet) that you can use to plunge in a more ‘controlled’ fashion!

The combination of heat/cold, gentle guidance, and clear home tips meant I was sleeping better, moving sooner, and relying on less pain relief than I expected.

Everyone at Honest Wellness is professional, kind, and genuinely invested in your progress. If you’re facing a knee replacement or rehabbing an injury, I can’t recommend them highly enough. I had very little pain throughout, and I credit a big part of that to their contrast therapy and support."

I cannot fault the afternoon tea, but the thermal suite was not up to a five star hotel standard. Everything was broken. Door handles, lockers, various thermal jet buttons, toilet flushers, and the chairs in the relaxation room were all broken. The thermal suite itself is dark, which made me feel ick due to wondering if it was clean. The layout of the thermal suite is poor because you can't relax in the pool while someone else is getting hit by a jet stream of water that splashes everywhere. It was all in all a very underwhelming experience. The only positive was the sauna. For the price to use even the thermal suite, don't waste your money. Skip this experience. || Edited: Honestly... don't bother. Seriously overpriced and pretentious. You would get far superior treatments at your local beautician.

Total marketing nonsense.

The treatment I had was very expensive, and not a patch on what I would get from my small local beauty salon. ESPA is very overpriced and pretentious.. it was like having a young one doing a fetac level 5 course, in the midst of the work experience module giving me a massage. I was not happy, a drop of Eucalyptus in a bowl under a massage bed is not an aromatherapy massage, the oil used to massage was basic, cheap, (non aromatherapy) and has affected my skin. ""Guided breathing"" was also the terminology used in the advertisement of this massage, I was told to take 3 breaths into the bowl of Eucalyptus at the beginning of the massage.. and this is what constitutes to aromatherapy and guided breathing here.

My treatment had also advertised a scalp massage with rose quartz crystals, when my ""massage"" was over, I had no scalp massage. When I asked why, she said ""oh, I don't normally do it in case it messes the ladies hair"", I told her I was looking forward to it so she gave my scalp a little scratch and I went on my way. I told the lady at the desk that I was looking forward to the rose quartz scalp massage which I never got, and was supposed to be in with my €155 massage to be told that this treatment isn't given due to covid 🤣

I was also charged for using the thermal suite when it advertises that it is free with treatments over a certain price (which mine was).

It states the sauna and steam room are not open due to covid, I was disappointed with this, but when I went in they were actually open, although other facilities in the thermal suite were broken. E.g., ice machine, the ""tropical"" and ""artic mist"" showers which are supposed to have aromas of flowers and mint do not.. as they are advertised, when I asked could they fix this I was looked at like I had two heads. I was also told we couldn't use the 'ice fountain' because of covid, which in my opinion is ridiculous. The steam room and sauna pose more risk theoretically.

Someone also stole my bra out of the changing room. I didn't even bother to tell them.

I would not go here again, or recommend ESPA to anyone, it's all for show. Looks the part though! || In desperate need of a renovation, the G Hotel Spa has totally lost its luster and is on its last legs. Several lockers are broken in the women’s changing room, towels were as scarce as hen’s teeth and the walls of the thermal suite are filthy. Plus they’re renovating guest rooms so the sounds of drilling and hammering permeated the treatment rooms… felt like I was having a facial in a dentist office. My esthetician was lovely and she’s the ONLY reason I gave the spa 2 stars. Don’t waste your money going there until the spa gets a full makeover!!! || Booked expecting a five-star spa, but it felt more like a tired hotel gym with candles. Overpriced treatments, rushed service, and staff who didn’t seem to care. Left more stressed than when I arrived. Definitely not worth it. || the thermal room was nice and relaxation room. I booked a spa treatment, the bespoke facial. The facial was not as expected, of course cremes on your face but very minimal and no true facial & shoulder massage. I believe it was cut short as it takes a bit to ask questions in the beginning. At the end therapist had left said she would return & after 10 minutes treatment ended. it was probably 40 mins & did not meet my expectations. Unfortunately Would not pay that much for treatment again or return"

The masseuse I was with talked for the entire duration of my massage which lasted an hour, about very personal things in her life  that were in no way appropriate for work environments and customer to client basis, it left me feeling extremely uncomfortable and  with no music either playing in the treatment room it was far from a  relaxing experience.

Turns out there was a poker tournament on in the hotel. We had not be told about it even while talking to reservations on the day of arrival. Rooms were dated and run down. We found items from the previous guests including medication. Food was sub standard, simple low quality but expensive. The hotel entrance was a large smoking area meaning our kids and erderly parent had to inhale second hand smoke. Gym is run down, with showers not working and a steam room the is broken weekly apparently. Car park is covered in dust and abandoned cars. This is not the 1000 welcome Ireland is known for. You exist the hotel to two bus terminals and a clinic. You are on the wrong side of Galway city. Food quality and dining experience are not worth the money. If you have to stay there head out including breakfast. Off peak the hotel was expensive, I am surprised this is a 4 star. The Radisson Blu used to be a jewel in the Galway crown. || We stayed on sat 24th January, arrived and checked in, room looked beautiful,  on closer inspection,  the door to ensuite wouldn't close properly,  and the toilet wouldn't flush properly,  the door was repaired very quickly,  we had dinner in the restaurant,  for a 4* hotel we found the food average at best. Had a great night's sleep,  used the pool facilities,  all very good, clean well maintained.  Went for breakfast,  a buffet,  some of the food was dried out, very disappointing as the hotel was very busy for breakfast. So overall a pretty disappointing experience, || It’s my second time staying in this hotel & I love everything about it. However, this time I want to draw particular attention to Yolanda (I’m not sure if I spelt it correctly sorry!) but she works as a therapist in the spa & she is an excellent therapist. I have been a massage therapist myself for ten years & have worked in well established 4 & 5 star hotels. It is very hard to find a therapist who will give a decent massage & Yolanda’s massage is absolutely outstanding. I arrived with severe back pain & I walked out of the treatment room feeling like I had a brand new back. I could not recommend her enough & she is fantastic at her job! Thank you so so much, I really needed that. || Hotel has a large lobby and plenty of sitting area. Check in is slow and can be busy if you check in at a busy time.  At times I saw a line that was 5 to 6 people deep.  Luckily, the line was short when I got there around 1 pm.  Hotel gets a lot of big bus tourists as well due to proximity to dt and bus/train station.  If you are unlucky to check in around the time a big bus pulls in, you could be in a very long queue.

The rooms are spacious as well and if you are lucky, can get a room with ocean view.  However, the bathroom is small.  The shower has a deep tub but the standing shower requires you to stand basically right next to the wall.  There is also not a tub door, just a small glass for the first quarter of the tub.  While this prevents shower water from rolling out easily, the bathroom still gets wet from the shower.  If you are standing and showering, water will splash everywhere.  I had to leave a towel on the floor parallel to the tub to soak up water that splashes out.

The breakfast is large and includes most options you would want.  I am glad I paid the 15 euro for bfast as it's a reasonable price for the quantity you get.

This hotel is known for its spa.  You will find a lot of locals here on a staycation as well.  I never used the spa but you do have to go down to the spa to use the gym.  This is where I was most surprised and disappointed with the hotel.  While the gym is on the spa floor, its entrance is separate.  Even with this, the gym hours are whatever the spa hours are.  On weekdays, gym does not open till 7 am.  On weekends and Bank holidays, gym opens at 8 am.  This is surprising bc 7 am is quite late for business clients.  I was here for business and it made for very tight mornings as I had to be down there by 7 to ensure I get a proper bfast, come back up to shower and get ready, and grab bfast before I need to be at work by 9.  The only connection to spa is the elevator you have to use (which is locked outside those hours) and you have to sign in at the spa desk.  I strongly recommend the hotel reconsider this policy.  If it could open the gym earlier, it provides flexibility to the guests and follows standard practice across most hotels.

Speaking of gym, its a very long gym that seems to have expanded over time.  The first 'room' is the biggest and has most of the machines you would want.  It also includes treadmills.  Once you past this room, you come to the free weights room and two other open space rooms. The free weights room is extremely out dated.  It looks like they took equipment that people were throwing away and bought it for free.  As you can see from the pictures, the equipment looks very rusted. They need to refresh this equipment.  The initial room doesnt have this issue; most of the equipment there is new or looks fresh.  However, there are a couple where the cushions are ripped and need to be replaced.

Overall, I give the hotel a 4. It has a nice restaurant, lobby, and spacious rooms.  But they lose a star for bathroom and most importantly the gym timing and quality of free weights. || The staff were nice, breakfast was good and the room was fine.
Unfortunately the function room below us was in full swing and no consideration was given to any of the people asleep in the rooms above. The noise level was so loud and the DJ definitely turned up the volume at 12:30 so to ensure that everyone above or near the function room was not going to get any sleep.
Not a place I would return to anytime soon."

The rooms are gorgeous, everything is immaculate, Sarah is a  gem of a host and wonderful source of local knowledge. From the steam room start, to the calming bath waters, to the delightful post bath snack, it was all perfect.
Don’t miss out on this lovely Connemara experience. || Sarah was such a delight and made our experience perfection! This experience was incredible from start to finish. We enjoyed the steam room, the nice, warm baths full of seaweed, and the delightful (and unique) fruit salad after! It was such a relaxing afternoon, and I’m eager to go again! || We spent a weekend in Clifden this January and were disappointed to find that most seaweed bath spas were closed—until we stumbled upon The Seaweed Centre, and what a hidden gem it turned out to be!

We rang on the day, and Sarah was incredibly friendly and accommodating, fitting us in for the last appointment at 5 pm. After a day of hiking Diamond Hill, this was the perfect way to unwind. From the moment we arrived, Sarah made us feel so welcome, and there was absolutely no rush.

The experience itself was fantastic—the steam room was the perfect way to start before plunging into the rejuvenating seaweed bath. We soaked for a full hour, completely relaxing and letting the seaweed work its magic. Afterward, we were treated to a delicious fruit salad, a thoughtful touch that made the experience even more special.

Sarah also shared some great recommendations for places to explore on the island, adding to our adventure. I would highly recommend The Seaweed Centre to anyone visiting the area—it's a must-do for relaxation and well-being!"

Great Gig, Leisureland Is a great venue, plenty space for parking, staff nice and it's a very safe spot. Only conplaint I have is, the Air Con. Could be so much better. Everyone was sopping by end of night. Otherwise, toilets clean, easy if you are in wheelchair. || Went here today with my young family. The kiddies pool was closed, slides closed and no aquapark,  but no mention of any of these closures on their website before we went there. The water in the pool was freezing, had to bring my smallest child out of pool after 40 mins due to blue quivering lips from the cold water and what seemed like no heating on in pool or changing areas.
I would not be going back here. We were so disappointed. || Super day out with the kids. Good size family changing rooms. Kids loved the waterslide. Not to busy. €32 for a family of 5 (2 adultd & 3 kids) Nice little coffee shop.
Parking is €2 per hour or €12 for the day. || I rarely leave negative reviews, as I understand mistakes can happen—but this really needs to be addressed.
We visited the swimming pool for the first time in a long while, and our kids were so excited. Unfortunately, the excitement quickly faded when we found out that half the pool was closed due to maintenance. Fair enough—we still paid full price, which we didn’t mind, assuming everything else would be up to standard.

But what shocked us was the level of dirt and neglect throughout the facility. The floors, changing rooms, and bathrooms were all visibly dirty, and there was a strong smell of urine that made the experience both unpleasant and unhygienic. It raises serious concerns about cleanliness and potential health risks.

This place clearly needs a deep clean and better ongoing maintenance. Really disappointing. || We skated, it was horrible! The skates are rusty and dull. The rink is all scratched. No one even cleans it! We expected the best, I don't recommend it!"

I highly recommend the experience and hospitality from Annette and Mabs. || Exceeded my expectations! This place is a total gem on Inis Oirr — highly recommend it. I had an excellent Swedish massage from MABs, who was very attuned to my numerous knots and sore muscles. And my complexion is glowing after a facial from Annette.

From the moment we reached out to book, everything was so personal and easy. The website directed us to email Brendan to arrange a morning, afternoon, or evening session. We mentioned we’d be driving the Ring of Kerry and might arrive a little late, and he couldn’t have been kinder—he even encouraged us not to miss the stunning Kerry Cliffs before heading over. It turned out to be perfect timing for a sunset soak!
When we arrived, the wooden barrels were already filled with perfectly hot water, ready for us to slip in and relax. We were greeted enthusiastically by Milo, the cutest dog in the world, which made the welcome even more special.
Brendan himself is genuinely one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. We had such great conversation with him—he used to be a tour guide, so he had amazing recommendations for the rest of our trip. His warmth and passion made the whole experience even more memorable.
This was truly an unforgettable experience and an absolute must-do if you’re anywhere near the area. Watching the sun set from a hot seaweed bath, surrounded by Irish scenery and good company, was pure magic! || If I could have one hour of my Wild Atlantic Way trip again, I'd take this one.

Despite it being January, I watched an otter splash around the emptied harbour and a wading egret. Behind them, the rolling mountains, sprinkled with sunspots.

All I had to do was I sit in wooden barrel of warm water with seaweed.

For a whole hour.

It was the best bath I ever had. || This place is honestly a hidden gem— not just for the price & experience, but for Brendan & Milo too! Our group of 4 had such a lovely time lounging in the baths overlooking the estuary, and Brendan was so accommodating when we ended up running behind schedule. In addition to the luxurious seaweed bath, we got to play with Milo who loves to try & catch water splashes. When we were first getting set up, Brendan was so chatty & cheerful asking about our itinerary and plans for our trip, and telling us about the process of collecting and soaking the seaweed. He went out of his way to provide recommended changes to our plans and even drew us a map of how to plan out our time. All of his recommendations were top notch and made our trip that much better. I would make the Sneem Seaweed Baths a habit if they were closer to me, and would definitely recommend anyone traveling to that part of Ireland stop in at least once for a soak! || What a wonderful way to spend an hour; in a seaweed hot tub overlooking beautiful bay and scenery. Invigorated and silky ! Thanks to Brendan for giving us great trip planning advice and Milo for playing with Trevor whilst we bathed ! || I will go back here EVERY time I’m in Ireland! The seaweed bath was incredible and the views were breathtaking. Most of all Brendan is a class act! He gave us a ton of advice and recommendations that helped us with the rest of our trip.

We stayed at this guesthouse for New Year 2026 celebration and were absolutely delighted. This place is a rare find where modern comfort and nature merge into one.
What especially impressed us:
Atmosphere and coziness: The house has chic panoramic windows, through which the pine trees and lake seem part of the interior. In the evenings, we lit the firepit — it created the magical relaxing atmosphere.
Outdoors and leisure: The territory is magnificently designed with barbecue area. Sitting by the open fire in the evening viewing pine trees and the lake is a special pleasure. There is absolute silence around, disturbed only by the sounds of nature.
Attention to detail: There really is everything for comfort here; every little thing is thought out, from kitchen utensils to convenient bathroom amenities (robes, slippers, towels, etc.)
For children: There is a lot of free space for children, they were always busy with outdoor activities, including inside and outside golf.
Service: The host is very attentive and hospitable, was always in touch, and made sure our vacation was perfect.
Conclusion: After the sauna, walks by the lake, and evenings by the fireplace, we feel completely rested.

And we returned to the house on Sunday evening to be greeted by 2 wild deer in the garden!! || This is a truly special place to stay. The house is stunning, as you would expect; even moreso are the grounds, with the lawn sweeping down to a long strip of rocky lakeshore - spend some time down there surrounded by trees, rocks and the sounds of the lake, taking in the extraordinary views, and feel the weight lift from your shoulders. Kayaking is a really important part of the experience here, the lake seems very safe and it's so easy to spend a few hours paddling around the nearby island and inlets , using the wetsuits and kayaks provided. Jump in for a quick swim afterwards and then relax in the sauna, which is excellent, as good as you'd find in any health club. We had some plans for Carauntoohill but the property was so nice we spent all our time there, and on the lake, instead. The whole setup, with the panoramic views and the lakeshore, is a bit like having your own private version of the Europe hotel.

As we arrived at St. Fionnán's Bay, we were immediately struck by its ethereal beauty. The crystal-clear waters shimmered under the golden rays of the sun, while the ancient cliffs loomed majestically in the background, their weathered faces bearing witness to centuries of history and legend.
But it was the holy well of healing that truly captured our imagination. Nestled amidst a grove of ancient trees, its waters were said to possess miraculous powers of healing and renewal. The air was thick with a sense of reverence and awe as we approached this sacred site, knowing that we stood on hallowed ground.

For filmmakers, St. Fionnán's Bay provided the perfect setting to capture moments of wonder and mysticism. From the tranquil waters to the lush greenery that surrounded the holy well, every aspect of this magical location seemed to radiate with a sense of otherworldly beauty.

As we watched the scenes being filmed, it was clear that St. Fionnán's Bay held a special place in the hearts of all involved. There was a sense of reverence and respect for the ancient traditions and legends that permeated this sacred landscape, infusing the film with a depth and authenticity that was truly captivating.

Our visit was a journey into the heart of Irish mythology and spirituality. The beauty and magic of this special place left an indelible impression on us, and we were grateful for the opportunity to witness its splendour firsthand. As we prepared to depart for Skellig Michael, we carried with us the memories of St. Fionnán's Bay, knowing that its sacred waters would forever hold a place in our hearts."

Lovely setting with panoramic windows overlooking the Liffey, all wood, stone and incense - very nice.
A lot of things being done properly here that aren't always done elsewhere in Irish saunas:
- properly hot saunas
- proper warm changing rooms
- Very clean everywhere
- Staff telling patrons to sit on towels and shower between saunas (basic but too many people won't do basic hygiene without being told to).
- properly cold plunge pools
- nice hot jacuzzis

Good value too. Keep up the good work! || Best sauna experience I’ve had in Ireland so far while visiting from Australia.
Option to have a silent or social sauna when booking. The views are amazing of the river and it’s actually cleaned between sessions which is something I haven’t seen much of in Ireland at other saunas.
The cold plunges and jacuzzi are great and the sauna is hot at around 95 degrees celcius. The staff are also welcoming and very clear on instructions when you adrive and tell people to shower after the sauna each time (something else I don’t see much of in Ireland)! Loved my session here.
Highly recommend and can’t wait to visit again. || Five stars doesn't do Treehouse Sauna justice.

Two saunas, two hot tubs, three cold plunges, two cold showers. It has everything you want. It is a little bit out of the way, but it's such great value at the same time.

One of the nicest saunas... actually the nicest sauna I've visited in Ireland. It's so clean, relaxing and aesthetically spot on. Can't recommend highly enough- i will keep on coming back 💯 || Absolutely phenomenal!
We had a magical hour this morning in The Treehouse. We were greeted by a wonderful  warm, friendly member of staff.  The envelopment of the river and surrounds was unreal. The design second to none.
10/10 for quality of sauna and pools. If I lived here I would definitely go on a regular basis. || Such a wonderful place to relax and recharge!
The sauna is always clean, cozy, and perfectly warm. The atmosphere is peaceful, and you can really feel the stress melting away. The staff are friendly and welcoming, and everything is well taken care of. It’s definitely my favorite spot to unwind after a long day — highly recommend!"

Well equipped for a hotel gym however. Air con made the right noises but certainly didn’t feel like it was on. Not a lot of loungers around the pool, no tables to go with the seats either so not the most comfortable to relax. The loungers had rolled up towels in the morning but this didn’t seem to be upheld throughout the day making it unclear which were free.

The sauna could do with new wood given it was very visible that it had absorbed several thousand people’s sweat with warped wood
The steam room had rusty light fittings and broken tiles.

I appreciated the window out to the pool from the steam room as I could watch people steal my lounger.

Only one flooded jacuzzi area, an outdoor space to cool down but nothing more.

On the way out, I looked for a swimming costume drier only to find none and given the lady at reception didn’t have spare robes I had to just walk back to my room damp.

Overall very tired and felt more like a local gym and spa than one at a world famous 5 star golf resort. || Very dissatisfied with a recent visit getting a couples message. I had Katie and she was amazing, 5 stars. They had a new girl in training and she was very underwhelming, no way she had any message experience. You shouldn’t be training personal on clients at the price for this experience. She didn’t ask my wife for any feedback regarding pressure. Basically paid for her to rub oil.  This isn’t the first time either. This is our second experience where my wife’s message was very poor. No opportunity to give feedback on our experience. How will they even know if new staff is any good? What was supposed to be a highlight for our trip from the states is now a big regret. Tried to treat my wife for the second time and disappointed again. || It was an awesome wrap-up to my  birthday with a treat to a full body massage. Had been to Carton twice before for a massage, but this visit was by far the best.
It was very welcoming and was extremely well looked after by Ciara.
Her attention to detail, professionism, and friendliness was 2nd to none. Best massage i've had in years. Listen to and tailored the massage to my needs.
Will definitely be returning. Lovely treat to a glass of prosecco as a birthday treat. The relaxation suite was a great way to chill afterwards. Refreshing sourbet and drink. Fresh fruit and plenty of flavoured water nice and cold available as well.
Leisure and pool were brilliant too. Spottless and really well laid out.
Finally the reception staff also need to be mentioned. So so important as the first and last person you see. Felt I was really being looked after with a warm friendly service. 10 out of 10. || From the momemt  we arrived we were greeted by a lovely gentleman who took care of our bags and welcomed us with a big warm smile.

The food was absolutely delicious and being able to watch the chef in action added a special touch.The staff were fantastic but in the restaurants and bar.

The spa was nice and I really enjoyed my seaweed massge.I think the pool area could maybe do with a revamp. Its a little dated. While myself and my sister in law were  unwinding, the boys played golf and came back raving about the course. They loved it!

Carton House is the perfect mix of luxury and warmth. Great service, stunning surroundings and walks, and plenty to do. We'll definitely be back! Highly recommend. || I visited the spa with my mum and sister-in-law as a special treat, and the whole experience was nothing short of exceptional. We each had a fantastic time and left feeling completely relaxed and looked after.

For me, I had an Indian head massage, and I can honestly say it was the best massage I’ve ever had. Natalia was truly exemplary – a kind, sweet-natured therapist who went above and beyond to ensure I felt comfortable and completely at ease from start to finish. Her attentiveness stood out, not just in the massage itself, but in the thoughtful little details – checking that the window was open for fresh air on a warm day, while also making sure I wasn’t too cold.

She created a calm and caring atmosphere that made the whole experience feel so personalised and special. It was clear she genuinely wanted me to have the best experience possible – and she delivered. Natalia is a true gem, and a big reason why I can’t wait to come back !"

Everything went very smoothly and the welcome, explanation of how to get the most from the Float experience, and getting set up was excellent.  Whole place was super clean, and warm.  Lots of space in my Float room to undress, shower, move around.  It all felt very safe both in the float tank and in the private float room.  Surprised how effective it was!  For the next few days, I was constantly being told how relaxed or thin or youthful I looked!  I attribute to the float experience and the salt and magnesium infused warm water. I will certainly return and I am very happy to recommend the place, the staff and the Float experience to everyone.  A+++ || Myself and my partner have been a member here for 2 years now and cannot recommend float therapy enough especially at Sli Beatha. The staff are excellent and always on hand to offer assistance and their knowledge on float therapy. I first started therapy due to a herniated disc… floating offered so much relief and decompression on my spine. I now attend to relieve every day stresses. It’s almost a different experience every time but have noticed incredible results in all aspects of mind and body and it’s fantastic for pain relief. Definitely recommend for anyone thinking about trying an alternative therapy. || We are blessed to have Sli Beatha here in Naas. I find I instantly relax the minute I walk in the door. Lovely welcoming staff and atmosphere. I have used both the pods and the room to float (pod is my favourite) and they are all super clean and well kept. Floating is so good for your mind and body. I feel like I've had a good night's sleep after my float. Highly recommended || Absolutely lovely experience at The Float House. Calm, welcoming atmosphere and such a deeply relaxing float. I left feeling lighter, clearer, and completely reset. Highly recommend if you need proper rest for body and mind. || Tried a floating bath for the first time. Was a bit afraid to feel claustrophobic but luckily could choose a bigger pod so didn’t have any negative feelings. I do struggle with muting my mind so it was not as meditative as I would imagine but I came out so rested. Few hours passed and I still feel like I am floating in another dimension :)
Might be that one hour was a bit too long for me, but will definitely give another go at some point in the future."

The advertised voucher clearly states it included one 60-minute treatment and one 30-minute treatment. When I used it last weekend, I was told I could only avail of one treatment (60-minute) due to time constraints, and I was asked to pay an extra €6 because the treatment price had increased. I also wondered if I am also entitled to the second treatment.

This was disappointing, as the voucher was pre-paid and advertised to include both treatments. Even though the massage itself was good, I left feeling the experience did not match what was originally promised. || I visited today with two friends.
We booked the spa and afternoon tea package.
Everything from start to finish was perfect!

My therapist was Shan. She was phenomenal. She put me compleatly at ease and proceeded to give one of the best back massages I've had. Followed by a gorgeous Elemis facial.

After this we had some time in the relaxation area and thermal suite. Both just as beautiful as the other.

Following this we went for a walk around the gardens before heading back into the main hotel for afternoon tea.
The selection was great, food was all delicious.

The staff are fantastic, super professional and all round lovely people to deal with.

We will absolutely be back and I highly recommend a visit. || Killashee Spa & Afternoon Tea Package €119.

The offering was fairly priced.

The staff was lovely.

The main hotel - food was delicious with generous portions with excellent customer service.

The decor of the spa and tea room was gorgeous.

We loved the hydrotherapy pool.

The massage area had an electric blanket, which was lovely and warm on the joints.

Why I provide 4/5 stars due to the masseuse - amazing technique but I asked several times to have a firmer massage my skin is quite sensitive and I reacted to the products used. (My masseuse was aware that I had sensitive skin). The 'relaxation' room - other guests were continuously talking.

But overall I enjoyed my experience and would return. || We tried the couple’s package and had such a lovely experience. The spa is very clean and peaceful, which made it easy to relax right away. Our package included the Rasul room and dry flotation, and I really liked that everything felt private, we didn’t have to pass by a lot of other people in between sessions, so it was just the two of us enjoying the time together. Everything finished off with afternoon tea, and the staff were super accommodating with our preferences, which made it feel even more special. I’d definitely come back to try their massages and facials for the full experience! Overall it felt very luxurious || I recently had the pleasure of visiting Killashee Wild Cherry Café, and I must say, it was a delightful experience! Nestled in a beautiful location, the café boasts a warm and inviting atmosphere that instantly makes you feel at home.

The menu is diverse, offering a fantastic selection of delicious dishes made with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. I particularly enjoyed their specialty coffees, which were expertly brewed and perfectly complemented my meal. The homemade pastries and desserts are a must-try; I couldn't resist indulging in a slice of their decadent cake, and it was absolutely divine!

The staff at Killashee Wild Cherry Café were friendly and attentive, providing excellent service throughout my visit. They took the time to ensure that every guest felt welcome and well taken care of.

Whether you're looking for a cozy spot to enjoy breakfast, a leisurely lunch, or a sweet treat in the afternoon, Killashee Wild Cherry Café is definitely worth a visit. I can't wait to return and explore more of their delightful offerings!

As for the Watershed itself it's a well equipped Sports Complex. The only thing is that it could do with an update in a few areas like the pool and Gym. Other than that I have no complaints. The Car park like any busy sports complex can be a bit busy during peak times. Its clean and nice and cosy warm during these winter days. || I never leve comment but this place got to me in too many ways.

- called the place over 13 times to no anwser, later when i came i see the phone ring and staff just ingore. But whatever.

- I ask staff about membership deals and offers, but lady at desk i feel like is kept againts her own will after 2 question just throw paper with details at me any any further question is anwserd by all is writen there again cool.

- can i go see try out gym ? No we don't do you need pay 11€ i mean that's a high price i think for a single entry buy sure,
And i think i know why u cant see before you pay. Most of equpiment is very heavily used, rusted, pads torn, not taken care of at all. Teenagers being very distruptive playing around at one machine for over 1h
No gym staff present for 2h i was there, to even report this.

-Male change room is poor condtion too smelly dirty, and good few happy nude granpas.

-On the way down insted of exit i went from gym to swiming pool no one checks i felt for what i paid it should be included,
And again rather dissapointing very dirty floor peoples hair everywhere, dirty underwear found in lockers.
The pool was actually okay nothing special, sauna and steam room was poor at best not very warm no option to pour water in dry sauna and very mild steam in steam room, only one jacuzi again filled with ultra happy teens.
Overall its an old decrepit place not worth its price in my opinion, with poor hygenie standards proably only in bussines because not many choice in town of kilkenny. For swim is ok but gym is 110% bot worth it. Not to mention the very good and helpfull part time robot staff. || Unfortunately all the school kids has lessons so only a very small area left for public. Very very noisy decided to use steam room and sauna lovely but jacuzzi was out of order which was disappointing.  The jacuzzi was not working last 2 times I have been . || I used to be a member here for 4 years around 7 years ago. I remember the gym being pretty well maintained. Now, the majority of it looks like it has been salvaged from a scrap yard. The few new pieces of equipment that i saw were all cheap or poor quailty. Yeah, you can say things are old. I think this place was built around 2010. But it's just pure maintenance, a little w40 every month. New pads every 6 months and deep clean costs a few hundred € at most.
And it would make a world of difference.
In conclusion, I'm sad to see this place fall down so much and would recommend any other gym in kilkenny. || I’ve been a member of The Watershed club in Kilkenny for over three years and usually have a great experience. However, during a recent badminton session, we extended our play by 30 minutes and were spoken to very loudly by receptionist ,as if we were being scolded.

I was delighted to partner with you for our Aqua Yoga Christmas session. Our group had a wonderful time from start to finish. Relaxing in the sauna, steam room and outdoor hot tub prior to our Aqua Yoga Class. We had a lovely meal in the restaurant afterwards and we look forward to repeating the experience. Many thanks,
Dolores and Aqua Crew. || Visited the hotel spa twice and was disappointed both times.

The main issue is with the online booking system — it’s poorly designed and causes a lot of confusion.

The first time, I arrived at my scheduled appointment and was asked to wait for my therapist in the relaxation area. Then I was asked to wait again… and again. In the end, I waited more than 45 minutes before the session started, which completely ruined the overall experience.

The second time, my friends and I organized a visit to celebrate a special occasion. We spent quite some time choosing the right time slot online to minimize waiting. One of us was a breastfeeding mother, so the timing was especially important. However, when we arrived, our reserved time was simply ignored — we were told to come at another available slot because our original time was given to other guests. This completely disrupted our plans.

The front desk communication was not friendly and felt somewhat pressuring. Instead of the three treatments included in our package, we only had time for two, as everything got delayed again.

The online booking system definitely needs a serious overhaul.

That said, despite all the technical and communication issues, I’d like to highlight therapist Mandjela — the massage itself was truly wonderful. || Hotel was great. Nice big room with plenty of space.
Has a small gym, pool and sauna.

Small bar called Quench which was pretty good with quick service and good food.

Recommend here to rest your tired legs and eyes after driving all day. || The staff were so nice, lovely calming experience and very relaxing. I went for a taster session of the back, neck and shoulder massage and the taster facial. Definitely would recommend. || Great Hotel

My friend and I visited to get facials, the dressing rooms were unavailable, we both left with exfoliator residue on our skin and in our eyes and noses. One of our therapists was very unprofessional and did not offer facial massage , bathrobe, slippers ,tea, relaxation area or pool,dropped things consistently, used her phone while working and was very rough applying products , and not thorough. Extremely disappointed in the service provided. My friend got hers for a discounted price which was a good gesture but paying 60euro for mine and for her 30 euro was extortionate considering the quality of the service. We both have experience in beauty services and have worked in the area ourselves and we're extremely disappointed by the whole visit. It was worse than being treated by trainees in a beauty school."

I wanted to wait for a while before leaving a review. I’m a big sauna enthusiast, so I was unsure about say the infrared for example, being lower heat. If you, like I was, are looking at purchasing a sauna from here wondering if this is an extravagant purchase that won’t be justified, let me tell you that this sauna is the best thing I own. I use it every day, both my partner and I, sequentially. We run it for 90 minutes, it’s up to heat in about 15 minutes. You are right beside the emitter, so the heat, even though it’s slightly lower than the wood fired sauna, is ample. I cannot do more than 30 straight minutes. And I’ve tried. It has worked flawlessly, takes up less room in my bathroom than the shower base, costs a negligible amount to run, and it makes me happy every time I use it. This business were brilliant in helping me select it, they were really helpful and patient with my questions and requests. I can’t say anything about aftercare because it’s worked flawlessly, but I have confidence they’re a great company.

Here’s my advice, buy the sauna. You won’t regret it. || I had absolutely amazing experience from start to finish with A Room Outside.

Assembly was perfect, with all the explanation of how to use it correctly, too. After one week of daily use of our sauna, I can honestly say that that was the best purchase ever! We both love it! My only regret is to not get one sooner.  I can not recommend Aroomoutside enough! Definitely 10 out of 10!!! || Great store, very friendly staff. Excellent product selection and great value. || I am impressed with the speed of shipping and delivery and the way of contacting the customer. I highly recommend shopping at A ROOM OUTSIDE to everyone who appreciates good customer service (thank you Marie). If all sellers were like them, it would be great. Thank you and best regards to the team. || This is the best BBQ / Braai / Outdoor cooking place I've visited in Ireland. They have a truly wide range and not just a select brand. Everything from Monolith and Kamado Joe to Traeger and Weber and everything in between. Most importantly they have a wide range within each brand and you really can find everything you want a get a glimpse of the stuff you never knew to look for.

More importantly than anything they are genuinely good folk. Knowledgeable, helpful and very nice people. I'll certainly be back  and definitely recommend popping in or going online and picking up some great gear."

A truly hidden gem. I did the salt cave and jacuzzi experiences and both were great. The salt caves have 3 warm/hot pools and two cold ones, free clay masks, saunas, massage chairs, and red light therapy. The jacuzzi area upstairs has less to offer (jacuzzi, sauna, and cold pool), but is privately booked for the same price as downstairs, and comes with a free bottle of processco!

As well as the excellent facilities, the staff were lovely. When myself and my partner were leaving, we couldn’t find my jacket. The receptionist Shauna helped us look everywhere, but it seemed to be lost. She took my name and phone number and said she would call other customers who had been there the same time as us and see if someone took it by mistake. Later on the same evening she texted me that the jacket had been found in the changing rooms, and she would keep it safe until I could come back. Very kind and considerate. Highly highly recommend. || Highly recommended! The lady at the reception was very welcoming and kind. We arrived at 5pm and the place was empty so luckily we had all the place for ourselves.

Definitely we will be back!! || We had a lovely time here we did the 3 hour experience and was fab I was nervous after reading some comments, I can agree with the comments about the clay mask used by all also the cold plunge pools were dirty ( one even had a plastic cup and others had dirt and leaves in them )and as others have said maybe bring 2 towels or would be brilliant if they supplied towels, but we had a lovely time. Thank you for a lovely experience || We had a nice experience at Salt Cave Paradise. It’s a great place for families — there are two separate rooms, one where adults can relax with calm music, and another where kids can play and have fun without disturbing the quiet area.

The staff were friendly and welcoming, which made the visit even more pleasant. A lovely spot to relax while the children stay entertained. || The girl on the desk was lovely and welcoming and explained everything as it was my first time. Bring two towels because you shower before entering the pool area and you’ll be left with only a damp towel to dry yourself with otherwise. The clay mask was lovely but the area you sit in to let it dry on the reclining chairs was freezing. Good selection of cool/warm pools filled with salts, herbs & essential oils, it smelled amazing. I only used the warm pools as the place was so cold. The massage chairs are very relaxing and comfortable. The pools themselves are very small so you can’t actually swim in them. You can only float. I wouldn’t go on a busy day as you’d have no room to move. It would be better to have separate male/female changing areas. Don’t shower for an hour after your visit to allow the saltwater to do its magic & definitely don’t shave before you go or it stings! The hour passes quickly. It was good to experience something new but I wouldn’t return due to the coldness and how small the pools are plus the price is too high for one hour. You can get two hours in a thermal spa in an upmarket hotel for the same price."

She really put so much effort in to make sure everything was perfect. I appreciated the comfortable positions of the massage and the adjustments that were made. I went in thinking it wouldn’t be as good as a normal massage, I was so wrong.

All of the staff were lovely, so friendly. A very inviting place.

I was also very happy that there was a few areas I was able to use in the spa being pregnant unlike some other places I researched. I didn’t feel like I was missing out at all. I could use the aromatherapy room, dip my feet/lower legs in the outdoor jacuzzi and rest on the heated loungers with the most beautiful river views.

The sorbet and tea afterwards was the cherry on top.

I was so happy with my experience and it was a great treat that put me in such a good state of mind, I’m going to go back again when I’m in a later pregnancy stage. || Oh what a gorgeous treatment I got. I must have hit the jackpot cos Mia was just brilliant. I got the bank neck and shoulders and Mia was just a whizz at unknotting the tension. Sometimes, i can be a bit sensitive but as tough and all as it was, i was like butter leaving the therapy room. Anyone in the west, head to Mia , I’m gutted I don’t live closer. || Beautiful hotel, gorgeous food and cocktails. The staff are brilliant. Highly recommend! || Venturing into The Chill Spa, I was immediately struck by the warmth and friendliness of the staff. It felt like being welcomed into a friend's home – if your friend's home included impeccable cleanliness and a zen atmosphere. Seriously, the place is so spotless, you’d think they have a magic wand for cleaning!

But the real gem is the outdoor experience. The hot tub on the deck, with its stunning river views, is nothing short of magical. It’s like sitting in a warm, bubbly throne while nature performs its best symphony. And the river, oh the river! It offers such a mesmerizing view that I found myself contemplating whether I should just pitch a tent there and live in this tranquil haven. Whether you're a spa enthusiast or a newcomer to the world of relaxation, This is a destination not to be missed. Absolute bliss! || Lovely spa with an amazing outdoor setting. The outdoor jacuzzis and baths were particularly fantastic, and my wife's massage was apparently amazing too. Loses one star as unfortunately our visit wasn't the most tranquil due to 80% of the other guests having their phones out for the entire time, despite this going against the ""spa etiquette"". Some guests were literally having phone calls in the jacuzzis, along with playing music/watching videos in the relaxation rooms and having photoshoots the entire time! Would be nice if phones were completely banned from settings like this."

I opted for the Lavender Dream Experience treatment due to 3 reasons:
1) I have sensitive skin.
2) I haven't had a massage for a couple of years, so I felt I could probably do with more than 1 hr. This treatment is 90mins.
3) Warm healing stones sounded very inviting.

The treatment in its entirety is truly divine... from the beautiful smell & texture of the organic Turkish scrub, the wonderfully soothing & relaxing Lavender body oil (warm & also organic) on the skin followed by the feeling of the smooth & warm stones gliding through one's tense muscles.

Beatrix applied just the right amount of pressure on the stones & also worked with her hands & forearm incredibly skillfully. She always checked if the pressure & sensations were ok or if I needed more.
She finished the head to toe treatment with an Indian head massage, which provided the ultimate tension release & relaxation. I felt I could have drifted to sleep in seconds.

After the treatment, I was led into the relaxation room where a shot of orange juice, small joghurt, some water & a lovely pot of herbal tea waited for me.

I cannot recommend the spa enough. It was my first time here and I'm certain I'll visit it again if I'm in Westport the next time. And I'll be looking for Beatrix👌
Thanks so much! || It seemed kind of dirty to me - especially the floors in the steaming rooms. There was some black, grey and green stuff swimming around underneath your bare feet. The pool was very cold and smelled of urin when entering. The people used the sauna and steaming rooms in bathing clothes and with no towels to sit on. When splashing the water in the pool, it produced some kind of foam on its surface. And finally, after using the massage jets in the pool, I got a weird kind of itching rash on my back skin. After 10‘ I left the spa again looking for a clean shower… || Just had a beautiful massage with Matilde. One of the best in my life’s.

The whole SPA Treatment would be more than perfect if the pool would be a little warmer, but overall, please come and enjoy here || I had a wonderful experience with the team at Spa Salveo. I received an amazing facial combined with neck, shoulder and hand massage but what really won it for me, was how Carol and the team went ABOVE AND BEYOND for me when I lost my Invisalign in the locker room (which was going to leave me out of pocket). They did multiple searches for me without me asking and they actually found it even after I had accepted it was gone. I'm so grateful to them. So genuine and caring.

He set up astroturf beneath the steps to the sauna and in front of the cold plunge to zone off the area and enhance the feeling underfoot. We were thrilled with the overall experience they provided and have booked them again. They were incredibly reliable and professional, very friendly to deal with, and I would absolutely recommend them."

Lovely thermal spa. Himilayan salt sauna is great. Many saunas and steam options to try out. Very nice decor, relaxing atmosphere even if there are lots of people there. 2 relaxation rooms, one warm, one normal temperature for reading or napping. There is water, tea, fruit to refresh you. Changing rooms are clean and spacious. The price for 2 hours in the thermal spa is good value and will relax you.

The cons: The jets in pool and jacuzzi are not ideally placed where they would reduce any back or neck tension. The new ""waterfall"" has barely any pressure either, so you will need to pay for a massage treatment to reduce any true stress held in your neck and back. You also need to activate the sensors about every 30 seconds - 1 minute, so this detracts from the experience a bit. The outdoor jacuzzi isnt very hot.

Cons aside, it is definitely worth a visit and paying for a massage treatment if required.  You will leave refreshed! || Today me and my boyfriend we have had a pleasure to come in your spa.
Hotel situated in the middle of the nature, and the position is really good.
We have really appreciate the service of your staff also the price.
We will definitely be back. || after covid this place went 90% down...what spa relax experience you have if: sauna - not working, both steam rooms - not working, outdoor jacuzzi not working... wait so what is actually working? for what I pay if I go there without warning that 90% of facilities is out of order? downhill very bad...except many others issues, here dusty showers and changing rooms. 👎 || Unfortunately not so great. I have been a regular visit to the Dunboyne and we have been going for years.  I wasn't too sure if we could use the new spa facilities being spa guests and felt uncomfortable from the start. Form that you sign were an embarrassment and half the information was missing. Should never have been put out. Very poor first impression. The spa is looking better and  I would say it will be nicer when it's done.  I don't intend to return. I didn't enjoy my treatments. Clothes to take off the facial products were so rough. Two different therapists did my treatments. I would rather have got the back massage first as my face was sore after the facial. I wish I would have asked for Rachel my usual therapist. Pity her details were not against my notes on the booking.  Food isn't the lobby has also gone up quite a bit. Only 1 option for jam with our scone. I just don't think the lounge boy wanted to look to be honest.  All in all such a disappointment. We were so looking forward to it. Two stars, one for the spa upgrade and the other for the lovely Rachel. I just want to mention that Gabriella did her best with my back massage and was so lovely, but I really just wanted to leave at that point. || First off the treatment was lovely, as was the staff and treatment rooms.

The big disappointment was the thermal area.
The outside tub was out of order, as were some of the steam/heat rooms, a significant number of jets in the hydrotherapy pool were not working.

The showers were quite mouldy and a lot of lockers in changing room were broken. There were no slippers left when I arrived and the robe had no belt.

The staff advised it's being renovated,  so maybe things will change, but at present don't go with high expectations of thermal area and you'll be alright."

From the moment I walked in,  I experienced a warm and welcoming vibe. All the staff were truly professional and accommodating.

I was went in for the ‘mum-to-be’ spa experience and the staff were super helpful on which of the facilities were appropriate for me.

Facilities were kept clean and tidy. Every detail felt thoughtfully designed with comfort in mind, which made it easy to fully switch off and enjoy the experience. It truly felt like a safe, peaceful haven for mums-to-be.

A special shout out to Alem, who delivered my treatment with such care, professionalism, and warmth. She took the time to explain everything, made sure I was comfortable throughout, and tailored the treatment perfectly to my needs. It was incredibly relaxing and I felt completely at ease in her hands. I couldn’t have asked for better.

I would highly recommend this experience to any mum-to-be looking for a truly relaxing, thoughtful, and luxurious treat. 🤍 || To describe the Spa at the Johnstown Estate in one word, I have use an Irish word “Suaimhneas”{ pronounced  Soo – in -ness} which means Peace, tranquillity, rest and quietness. If that is what you are looking for, this is the place for you. Everyone needs a treat during our dark and dull winter. We started off in the rooftop jacuzzi and then went into the thermal suite ( I love the tropical showers). Then we floated off to our treatments. My favourite treatment is the Elemis Facial. We ended the day with a yummy lunch. All the staff there are top class (Reception staff, Therapists and Waitresses). Jessica at Reception was very helpful and made our half day there feel like a holiday.  We were there last week for facials with Naomi and Rosa who were excellent. We were also there twice in Autumn for treatments and our therapists were Nora, Vita , Katia Z and Ana Marija, who were top class. Go raibh maith agaibh go léir {thank you everyone }…for giving us “ Suaimhneas”. Nollaig Shona Daoibh { Happy Christmas} See you all next year. || Excellent Facilities, everything was very clean. The full body massage was something else.
Staff super friendly helpful and explained every step in details.
I highly recommend and can't wait to be back. || I spent three hours at the SPA, choosing the full-body massage and lunch option. I recommend this place to everyone. The place is fantastic, and the service is very helpful and friendly. From the reception, where I was greeted by two wonderful women, Jemma and Allanah, who explained all the details and patiently answered my questions. To the fantastic full-body massage given by Maggie, who took care of every detail and the atmosphere in the room. Finally, I enjoyed the incredibly friendly service when choosing lunch and the restaurant, where Jenny and Maya took care of everything. I will definitely be back. || Fantastic Spa. Thermal suites have all the usual facilities, the only thing it's missing is an ice area. A couple of more clocks wouldn't go astray as there is only one in the hallway and it would help when trying to manage your time pre treatments . Plenty of water stations. All doors and dressing room lockers work with a wrist band. The outdoor area is lovely, has a hydro pool, two jacuzzis, showers and seating area. The treatment rooms are lovely. Every area was spotlessly clean and doors and windows were being cleaned every now and again .I had the signature massage and would highly recommend it. All the staff were very nice. Separate relaxation area near the treatment rooms with water beds. Not essential but herbal tea or sorbet would be a nice offering post treatment. You can keep the flip flops and spa bag when leaving. There is a Cafe area at the Spa reception, plenty of people were eating there and having afternoon tea."

After dinner, either have a drink in the bar or the many alcoves available.
The Leisure Centre was excellent, good sized pool, with Sauna and Steam room separate. Hot tub outside, which I had all to myself.

Nice walk around the surrouding woods. || We had a truly wonderful stay at The Johnstown Estate Hotel. From the moment we arrived, the staff went above and beyond to make our time special.

Alex and Keri at reception were absolutely fantastic—warm, welcoming, and incredibly helpful over email before our stay. Their kindness and efficiency made everything feel easy and well-organised.

The pool reception team were also very friendly and inviting.

The cleaning staff were consistently friendly in the hallways, and our room was spotless, comfortable, and beautifully kept.

We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and will definitely be coming back. || Such a lovely hotel. The staff are so friendly. From the front desk to the restaurant. The service was impeccable. Especially from Emma and Sarah.
I had a massage with Naomi and it was honestly one of the best I've had.
My only negative is that Netflix doesn't work in the bedrooms. || We had a wonderful time at this hotel with my loved one.
The rooms were clean and well maintained, with coffee and tea available. A very pleasant surprise was the birthday greeting left in the room — a handwritten card and sweets, which added warmth and attention to detail.

The staff at every level were polite, attentive, and highly professional. The SPA area was a whole separate experience — clean, peaceful, incredibly relaxing, and truly at a top level. In the relaxation room there were fresh fruits and chilled lemon water, which was a very nice bonus.

We would also like to give special thanks to the massage therapist Julia — the massage was done very professionally and with great care.

Another pleasant surprise was the restaurant — everything we ordered (soup, smoked salmon salad, chicken wings, and steak) was tasty and well presented.

Overall, this is a wonderful place for rest and relaxation. We truly recommend it! || Staff and service at the Hotel were lovely we had a very nice meal in the Coach House and were served by Nixon who is a great asset to the Team there we had a nice chat with him. The room we allocated was on the ground floor courtyard level and the room was fine except for it was way too hot the radiator was on non stop and the thermometer in the room doesn't seem to work so we opened the window to discover that the noise from the Leisure Centre Boiler was extremely loud.  The TV in the room just had basic channels couldn't use the Smart TV function when we checked with reception they told us it was old technology on the TV. I know that other rooms haves Smart TV's that work because I have stayed here previously. We were staying for a night away after myself and my partner recently had bereavements in our families so we were there to relax and use the facilities it was just a pity about the TV in the room. Used the pool and leisure centre thermal suite all very nice and the outdoor hot tub was not busy either on Sunday morning which was great. The hotel is lovely and staff are wonderful it's just a pity about the room not being what we would have expected."

Back in Australia, I pay the equivalent of €13 per week for unlimited access to modern, high-quality gym (and pool) with brand new equipment,  so this was a major letdown.

The pool itself was nice, but the jacuzzi was lukewarm at best, and the steam room wasn’t great.
The changing rooms were also disappointing,  about half the lockers were broken or in poor condition, and I even had to pay extra to use the hairdryer - and it was not modern to say the least.
On top of that, you lose 50 cents each time you use the lockers.

Overall, a very underwhelming experience. If you’re going to charge these kinds of rates, the facilities should be up to date, and the pricing should be clear and honest. || When we get home from abroad, we always venture to Coral leisure with our children and their cousin. It is  a great facility. The staff is very friendly and attentive. There is one lifeguard (of course we didn't get his name!) but our son will remember him  fondly for a long time to come. He chatted to him about his swimming skills and gave him goggles as he forgot his. He also volunteered to throw our son in on several occasions. All of the children loved being around him and he is a real asset. We hope to see him again when we return!! || Was pleasantly surprised at how clean and well-kept the swimming facilities are.  The kids had a brilliant time going up and down the slide and the place wasn't overcrowded. The girls at the front desk were really nice and the staff at the pool kept the slide open for ages to the kids could enjoy.  Will definitely be back. || I have been to a lot of swimming pools in my life and this is the only one that changes you money to use a locker."

It's a place where you can unwind and indulge in a luxurious yet affordable treatment that feels deeply connected to the local environment.
The main event, of course, is the seaweed bath, which uses locally and hand-cut fresh seaweed. There are several options available, and we highly recommend booking the twin room with the Atlantic Ocean view. It's an absolutely stunning setting—there's nothing quite like lying in a warm seaweed bath, looking out at the ocean and the sky through the window, with a gentle breeze coming through. This option also gives you access to a quiet relaxation room where you can unwind with the same incredible view.
Regardless of the room you choose, each one is a private sanctuary equipped with its own small shower and steam room. The staff recommends a few minutes in the steam room before your bath to open your pores and maximize the therapeutic effects of the seaweed.
Beyond the baths, VOYA offers a variety of other treatments, including massage and reflexology, all delivered by a well-trained, attentive, and polite staff. The whole experience feels incredibly professional and relaxing from start to finish. You can also purchase their own range of seaweed-based cosmetics, which are a great way to take a piece of the experience home with you.
VOYA Seaweed Baths is more than just a spa; it's a place of tranquility and rejuvenation that feels luxurious without being pretentious. It's a place we are already looking forward to returning to. || Seaweed baths are simultaneously relaxing & enlivening & I love them. I’ve been to Voya numerous times over the years & intend to go again whenever I’m in the west. The Baths are set back from Strandhill’s beautiful beach. The staff are warm & friendly & the rooms are clean & unfussily functional. You leave feeling great. 3 quibbles. The steam in the mini sauna beside the bath automatically cuts out halfway thru your 50-min session unless you remember to ask to have it reset & the person you ask remembers to do it. The shower in the mini sauna doesn’t have an ice-cold option. (Why?!) And the seaweed-derived products on sale are insanely expensive. But still: just having a seaweed bath is such a pleasurable experience. 🙂 || We were helped my Ciaran. His customer service was top notch and made our experience extra special.
My mom and I shared the Knocknarea view and it was incredible!!!!
Can’t wait to do it again x || An Unforgettable Escape: Pure Bliss at Voya Seaweed Baths!

From the moment we stepped into Voya Seaweed Baths, we knew we were in for a truly special experience, and it absolutely delivered! Our visit was nothing short of 2+ hours of pure, unadulterated bliss.

We had the immense pleasure of indulging in a wonderful seaweed bath in the exquisite Atlantic Seaview Suite. This twin room offered breathtaking panoramic views of the vast, calming ocean, creating an immediate sense of tranquility. Submerging myself in the warm, mineral-rich seaweed was an incredibly unique and deeply relaxing experience – my skin feels amazing.

Following the bath, I was treated to a massage by Megan, who is, without a doubt, a phenomenal massage therapist. Her expert touch melted away every last bit of tension, leaving me feeling completely renewed and profoundly serene.

The journey of relaxation continued in the inviting relaxation room. It was everything one could wish for: warm, cozy, and adorned with the same stunning ocean views. The soft glow of scented candles, the luxurious feel of fluffy robes (available in multiple sizes!), the sparkling cleanliness of the space, and the perfectly curated spa music all contributed to an ambiance of ultimate peace.

Voya Seaweed Baths truly offers a sanctuary for the senses. Every detail is meticulously crafted to ensure a deeply restorative and unforgettable experience. We left feeling pampered, rejuvenated, and already dreaming of our next visit to Ireland. This will be on the itinerary. Highly, highly recommend! || Voya spa is amazing, I had fabulous seaweed bath and bespoke bliss treatment there, the hot oil back massage was absolutely unbelievable - thanks to Megan, no words, I highly recommend, I will be back"

I really recommend Sarah, she is a great therapist and a lovely person. The facilities were very clean, the service excellent and lovely staff. The Icon Spa is cosy, quiet and very relaxing. I will book again. || Gorgeous spa with loads of facilities. The sea weed baths are outside which I throughly enjoyed on the windy and drizzly day that was in it. I got a Swedish full body massage from a lovely lady called Natalia and it was honestly the best massage I ever had. Would highly recommend her! The castle and grounds itself are beautifully kept , will deff be back again ! || Worst experience ever! Was booked in at 5pm for treatments so used the thermal suite before hand, very basic.

After our treatments the therapist just left the room without saying anything and we weren’t brought to the relaxation room just straight to the changing rooms. I had a shower and whilst blowing drying my hair, a worker barged into the changing room while my friend was getting changed and told us to “hurry up they close at 6 and we don’t get payed” was extremely rude so I left with wet hair.. do not take bookings at 5 if you can’t fit people in. If I could I’d rate it 0 stars || Don’t go here! Today my party of 6 were met with a cold, unwelcoming arrival by each staff member in the icon spa. A lot of the facilities advertised were not working or working poorly. The steam room was off, the heated seats were cold, the relaxation room had no hot water for tea, I asked for some and it took 35 mins to be brought in, the outdoor “hot” tub was reading 36 degrees and I went inside to ask staff could it be turned up higher and they said that it was just the weather that was making it cold. I paid for a scalp, face and shoulder massage however the staff member doing it was completely inexperienced, I’ve had a few of these treatments in other spas and I know that this was totally not the way it should have been done it was actually painful and uncomfortable at times. Also in the treatment room I was only covered up by a single towel on the bed rather than a warm blanket. When the treatment was finished the staff member told me she’d wait for me outside the door which she didn’t. I was eventually taken back to the relaxation room which was untidy with used cups and unfolded blankets not fixed from people that had previously used it. The chairs in the relaxation room also looked dirty and stained. When we finished and went to get changed I tried to use the shower but the water was cold, I informed a staff member and asked could I use the golf club changing rooms instead and she didn’t even apologise and just told me “those showers are probably the same”, no alternative given, she acknowledged the water was cold and didn’t even apologise for it. We also had an issue with the way the manager spoke to one of my party guests which actually made her feel anxious and uncomfortable to continue with the treatment. This was resolved however the manager handled this situation totally unprofessionally. She also informed us that one of her colleagues cut one of our party’s treatment short and told us to “write a review and mention his name on it” which was totally unprofessional. In summary, a number of issues arose during this experience and staff were cold, unapologetic and completely unprofessional. We are a group of hard working individuals who were here as a treat for one of my friends birthday. This was also mentioned upon booking and written by 3 party guests on our consultation forms and not one member of staff acknowledged this. I will never be returning here and I will recommend that friends and family do not attend here. || Has a full body massage and facial with Lauryn this afternoon, and I can't praise her enough. I told her at the beginning that I prefer a good hard massage and that's exactly what I got.
The massage was excellent and the facial was so relaxing that I almost fell asleep. Had the relaxation area to myself before and after, and love fresh fruit and herbal teas. Been to the ico and few times over the years but its definitely improved."

We ate in the hotel the first night in Waves bar and it was delicious. Service was really efficient. The room was spotless and very comfortable. I’d highly recommend this hotel. || My partner and I booked this hotel as we were in Sligo for a friend’s engagement party and wanted to treat ourselves. We’d booked just a standard room with a double bed but unfortunately when we went into our room there were 2 single beds there.

The room was gorgeous and had beautiful views, we didn’t want to leave! Fabulous hotel with incredible staff. We will definitely be back to enjoy the hotel and all it has to offer in the future as this was just a quick visit. || We stayed for two nights over the New Year and had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel was nicely decorated for the Christmas period with a huge Christmas tree in the lobby.
Our room was spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable.
Food was superb with a buffet breakfast, room service and meals availble to order throughout the day. You must book the Brasserie restaurant for evening meals
All staff were very attentive, friendly, helpful and professional.
The Radisson is conveniently situated close to Sligo town and is a good base for exploring the surrounding area. || Really nice hotel but let down by breakfast. We had a really lovely stay and were given an upgrade to a suite which was fantastic. Amazing views and great facilities. Breakfast in the morning was a dissapointment. We arrived at breakfast 15 minutes after service started so were expecting fresh food..... fried eggs were solid, bacon overcooked and hard, scrambled eggs cold and dry. Despite the bad experience at breakfast it was a really nice stay with friendly staff and a warm welcome. 5 Stars for Hotel, facilities and staff 3 Stars for breakfast || Recently had one night at the Raddison in Sligo. Receptionist on check in was fabulous. Checked us in early and gave us lots of info on local spots and the ammenities within the hotel. Room was fantastic, clean and comfortable with a king sized bed. Pool and spa ammenities were great. Now, being the only restaurant/bar in the local area, we didn’t have any other dining options so we headed to the main bar of the hotel. We were excited to order some of the monthly cocktail specials and sit at the bar. Unfortunately the service was so bad that we were left laughing in utter disbelief. Hungover, inattentive and disinterested and still convinced the bartender didn’t put any alcohol in our cocktails. The food was awful especially given the price.

I really appreciated that we could stay with our dog.

However, the pool and spa area felt a bit disappointing.
It didn’t feel particularly luxurious.

Vegan food options were the biggest issue.
The hotel said they could provide vegan meals, but unfortunately the breakfast wasn’t a genuine vegan option. We were charged full price for a breakfast that was essentially:
•	Plain bread (no vegan butter provided)
•	Baked beans
•	Cooked tomatoes

It felt more like items removed from the standard cooked breakfast rather than a thoughtfully prepared vegan alternative. Because of that, it didn’t feel fair to be charged the same price as a full breakfast.

Overall:
Lovely that they welcome dogs, but the spa and vegan food options need improvement. If the hotel says they can cater vegan meals, a proper, considered vegan breakfast would make a big difference. || We stayed here while on a tour. The hotel itself is conveniently located, and the main areas were well kept. My room was clean and decent sized, if a bit dated. Being that it is an older hotel, unfortunately there were limited plugs close to the bed, so I would recommend having an alternative charging method for your devices.

Now, onto the areas for improvement: We had dinner in the dining room, and although the staff were kind, there just weren’t enough servers and they looked stressed while rushing to assist everyone. Secondly, the biggest area for improvement is lack of communication. Backstory: Due to an incident with my chronic illness, I overslept and was rushing the next morning, resulting in me leaving some items behind (my fault). However, I contacted the hotel via their “contact us” page on their website within the hour. I then followed up 3 days later with an email in hopes of me paying to ship the items to family in London. It has now been over a month since I contacted them and no one has responded in any way.

I’ve personally worked in the hotel industry and I would expect better from a “4 star” hotel. || I had a wonderful stay at Sligo Southern Hotel. The rooms were spacious, clean, and very comfortable, making it easy to relax and feel at home. The food was absolutely superb, with a great variety and delicious flavors that really stood out. On top of that, the service was excellent – the staff were warm, attentive, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure everything was perfect. Overall, a truly enjoyable experience and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Sligo. || We stayed for one night. The hotel website says it is dog friendly but when we checked in they had not allocated us the right room so we had to wait while the staff made another room ready and we had to pay an extra charge. We then came down to the bar for a drink, but our dog was not allowed in the bar. The room was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was very good but our dog was not allowed in the restaurant. Sligo Southern Hotel you really need to sort yourself out and make the rules clear for your guests. || I stayed here for an overnighter. The food was excellent and the room was lovely. The added touch of a packet of tayto crisps and water was fantastic.
Great service, the staff were so friendly and accommodating."

I had a fantastic stay at the Clayton Hotel Sligo and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area. From the moment we arrived, the staff were warm, welcoming, and extremely professional, making check-in smooth and stress-free. The hotel itself is modern, well-maintained, and has a very relaxing atmosphere throughout.

The rooms were excellent – spacious, spotless, and very comfortable. The bed was especially comfortable, ensuring a great night’s sleep, and the room was well equipped with everything needed for a pleasant stay. The bathroom was clean and modern, with good water pressure and quality toiletries, which is always appreciated.

The facilities are one of the hotel’s strongest points. The leisure centre is fantastic, with a well-sized swimming pool, sauna, steam room, and a fully equipped gym. Everything was clean, well organised, and easy to access, making it perfect for relaxing or unwinding after a busy day. The overall layout of the hotel makes it feel calm and enjoyable without being overcrowded.

Dining was another highlight. The food was of very high quality, with a great variety available at breakfast and in the restaurant. Everything was fresh, well presented, and tasty, with attentive staff ensuring a pleasant dining experience.

Overall, the Clayton Hotel Sligo offers excellent value, great facilities, comfortable rooms, and outstanding service. I would absolutely stay here again and would confidently recommend it to couples, families, or anyone looking for a high-quality hotel experience in Sligo. || I can't say enough good things about our trip to this hotel. The staff are wonderful. The food is excellent. The hotel was gorgeous. Sligo is a beautiful town. The scenic Rosses point is also close by. We had the most incredible weekend. The staff at the Clayton are incredible. || Was such a wonderful location and everything so nice and the staff very welcoming. Beds were nice if a bit over firm to my liking. The separate entryway door to bath and bedroom was an odd thing but fine.
Only real complaint was how stuffy the room was especially since the window was child locked and could barely open. I get that it's a safety thing but we were two grown adults would have been nice to have the option to close it.
Food was nice especially the main courses though nothing mind blowing and one dish slightly under-seasoned but was still good. Breakfast was very tasty and plentiful for the buffet, exactly what we needed that morning. Though could have put a strainer on the scrambled eggs so they weren't so watery at the bottom.
We ordered room service late at night which I appreciated was available.
The pizza we orders was serviceable but no complaints as just a midnight snack level. They did seem to forget the pizza the first time as they only brought up a single drink then as it was getting a bit longer than expected we called and they said they'd be up in 5 minutes which was slightly longer with two new drinks with half melted ice and the pizza. This isn't really much of a complaint just something we noted and laughed at at the time.
All in all a nice stay with good amenities that most will be satisfied with just don't expect anything super mind blowing from anything but the location and buildings. || Lovely staff and the rooms were huge. Beds comfortable of course. Facilities were good as was the breakfast and the bar/restaurant served very tasty food in large portions. Price was only slightly higher than some of the top end eateries in the town.
The bar lacked a sense of comfort or style however and with no windows did feel a bit utilitarian.
My second room lacked bedside sockets which is kind of standard elsewhere for bedside phone charging. Final negative is some of the corridor doors had hard stops which meant lots of racket for people occupying rooms in those sections when other guests were passing to their own rooms. Mine was a 2 way swing so not an issue but I did make a lot of noise with the main corridor access door when first arriving and when I forgot.
In summary: food, staff, room size, comfort excellent.
Noise, styling and some utilities à bit poorly thought out. || Absolutely amazing service throughout the hotel especially during breakfast. Served by Ewelina and she was Absolutely brilliant, she was so kind and helpful throughout breakfast service. She seated us and our young children where we had plenty of room, she brought out beautiful porridge to us and some croissants wishing us a happy anniversary.  Every time we seen her she had a big smile on her face and nothing was too much, I watched how she greeted everyone with the same friendly approach.  She is an asset to the hotel and is amazing at her job! Our room was lovely and clean and we loved the gym and swimming pool. Cannot wait to stay again! Thank you"

Everything was easy, relaxed, and staff welcoming.

The hotel is great for families — loads of space, nice grounds for strolls by lake, and a really comfortable atmosphere. The room was clean, spacious, and ideal for us, and the beds were really comfortable.

Food was excellent, with plenty options for both adults and kid, Breakfast was particularly good !Staff were friendly, helpful, and throughout our stay. You never felt rushed or like you were “in the way” with kids around, which makes such a difference.

Leisure centre and pool were great as well.

Overall, it was a very enjoyable, stress-free family break and we’d happily return. Highly recommended for families looking for a relaxing stay. || Booked the weekend here with my best friend and I have to say, the views are outstanding and the atmosphere was amazing.
The food in the bar was gorgeous and the service was good but not being able to charge anything to my room left me feeling untrusted and extremely disappointed. The staff did clarify that this stopped due to Covid and it just hasn't started up again which is fair enough. But I do believe this should've been mentioned before or when I was checking in. It left me wondering why does the hotel take my card details if i can't charge anything to my room? Especially since I'd already paid in full.
As for the room, when I first entered I noticed the stains on the counter underneath the TV. Not a very good first impression. There's no safe so I couldn't put any valuables or keys away. No mini fridge, lights full of dust, bedding not very fresh, under the beds not hoovered and the shutters don't close properly as they're missing parts and let the light in. The beds are comfy but not the duvets or pillows. I woke both nights with the cold, checked the radiator, heating not on, took the duvet off the other bed and threw it over me as well. The pillows are sweaty, small and hard. I couldn't use them.
In the bathroom there's no hand rail for towels at the sink. Clean towels constantly put for wash cos they kept falling off the toilet onto the toilet brush. The tap doesn't move so it was awkward brushing my teeth and the height of the bath is way too high for me as I'm only five foot nothing 😅 I really struggled stepping in and out! 😅
The breakfast is definitely worth it. The staff are well organised and always on hand to help. || The staff are simply excellent. Nothing was too much trouble and they were really engaging with the kids.

Great value break - room are basic but clean / nice. Food was very good. The staff make this place really authentic - we'll be back. || I was really impressed with the hotel,  it was perfect for a family weekend. There was 17 in our extended group, and we were all impressed.  The food was really good,  the interior decoration was very quirky and I loved it. I've stayed in many beige hotels and I appreciated that this hotel went with a bolder style and did it well.

It was busy but there was lots of staff on and the service was excellent.
I loved the bedrooms,  again bold decoration but really well done.

We went for a walk on the Belvedere Estate and it is really beautiful and well worth a visit.
I will definitely go back and would recommend. || Very disappointing pamper day at the spa. 3 of us arrived to no member of staff to greet us. Had to phone hotel to get someone. Then it was the pool boy who didn’t know a thing to be honest about the area. Very disjointed and won’t be returning. I planned this as a nice relaxing day away for my friends and it wasn’t this. Very unsatisfactory."

The suites themselves were fine in terms of basics – the beds were comfortable and everything we needed was there – but they are very dated and could really do with an upgrade. Simple improvements such as smart TVs, some fresh paint around the resort, and more practical bathroom features (e.g a shelf in the shower to put toiletries) would make a huge difference. The suites were also very hot, and there were no instructions on how to control the heating.

We enjoyed the spa. Although it was quite busy, the facilities themselves were good, and we were especially grateful to the spa receptionist who kindly helped us rebook a session on the same day after we realised we’d accidentally booked for the wrong month – that was very much appreciated and handled brilliantly.

Unfortunately, our experience in the hotel bar really let the stay down. We were surprised to find that you couldn’t simply use the bar at your leisure, you had to book, give your name, room etc. When we visited in the afternoon (around 2pm), we were told the tables would be needed back at 5pm, which was absolutely fine. However, as 5pm approached we were repeatedly reminded, and at 4:55pm – while we were finishing our drinks – a member of staff came over and told us we'd have to leave, and when we said we were just finishing up and still had a few minutes, he made a snarky comment about us having already overstayed the two hours, despite us never being told there was a two-hour limit, only that the table was needed at 5pm. As a group of 10 who had spent a decent amount on food and drinks, the tone and approach made us feel very unwelcome. There were plenty of empty tables when we left, and no effort was made to relocate us - maybe they had bookings coming up but no one went in while we were sat in the lobby after (where we had to sit to finish the drinks). This interaction left a really bitter taste and unfortunately means we wouldn’t return. || I stayed for a one night bed,  breakfast and evening meal break with two friends. I have to say its been a long time since I experienced such amazing service. The staff couldn't have been nicer, so accommodating, they made us feel like our enjoyment was their top priority. Amazing experience || Had a really lovely one night stay including dinner. Check in was quick and friendly, the room was modern with a balcony and seating which would be ideal in the summer months. There's a short walk to a private beach which we didn't do due to the incessant January rain but the hotel more than made up for this.
The bar is busy but cosy for a few pre-dinner drinks. Food was lovely and 2 seats at the bar counter topped our night off perfectly. Fiachra the barman was a pleasure to chat to and watch in action, and he makes a wonderful Amaretto sour!
A huge and very comfortable bed for a good night's sleep followed by a buffet breakfast and a trip to the spa for a treatment the next morning was the perfect way to finish our stay.
We will 100% be back. || Booked to use the thermal suite for 2 hours. It was so overcrowded and the complete opposite of a relaxing experience. Couldn't find a free locker on arrival, put my valuables in my friends locker and my bag on top of the lockers. Afterwards we had to queue and wait for a shower - just way too many people booked in & the majority were not hotel guests. Greedy to be accepting that many people into a slot in my opinion. Would not recommend or return. || Came here for a friends wedding and they couldn’t have chosen a better place. Hotel is beautiful and surrounded by beautiful countryside. Rooms were very clean and views were great. Staff were fantastic and very warm and friendly. Had dinner with a large group at the Bar and Grill the night before wedding and all the food was superb if a little overpriced. Again service here was fantastic. Stunning beach with a great walk down. Came away with some great memories and would love to return at some point in the future. Also plenty of parking if a little scattered around complex."

Very well run and highly recommend - a little piece of heaven 😎 || The best sauna facility that I’ve been to thus far. I couldn’t fault a thing a thing about it. The attention to detail that the owners have is second to none. Sauna temperature is the perfect and the ice baths aren’t any different . A lot of thought, time, money and effort have been put into the facility and you can tell the second you walk in. Superbly maintained. My regular spot from now on in Blackwater. || A wonderful little peaceful oasis in Blackwater village. Great sauna and overall set up. I went with my mum and we were made to feel very welcome. We even tried the  compression boots which was really relaxing muscle therapy. Excellent value for money!"

The hotel itself is lavish and lovely with lots of comfortable little lounge spaces, a restaurant, a pub and other amenities. The room was comfortable and spacious while the bathroom had a great shower and was also lovely and clean. The only negative in the whole space is I wish we had a small fridge in the room. The spa itself was amazing, cozy and relaxing and had all the amenities you need. The spa was also surprisingly very affordable too. The hotel breakfast was absolutely amazing - the best hotel breakfast I’ve ever had and had a massive array of offerings for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. Thanks Brandon house for allowing us to ring in the new year in the best way possible! || both me asd my wife stayed here for one night it is somewhere we have always wanted to stay.
upon entering the hotel you are welcomed in to a nice bright reception area and the staff made us feel very welcome,
we checking in and went to our room, upon entering the you could see that it was very clean if a little out dated but the thing that puyt us off was this room at sometime had a wall going through it and even tho they have attempted to remove it they didnt do a great job as we kept tripping on the footing of it hidden under the carpet, as i said the room were a little out dated and could have done with a coat of paint and some of the tyles in the bath room were chipped and missing bit leaving sharp edges which you could have cut you feet.

So we got settled and desided to go for a swim again the pool area could have done with a bit of a spruce up but it was nice none the less but the waterr was freezing cold, although at time we did feel a little imtimidated when we went to use the jacuzzi  because there was a few (lets say undesirables in there)
so we just left.

later we went to the restaurant for some food we were shown to a table given a menu and and asked if we wanted anything to drink we gave our drink order but had to wait 20 mins for thast to arrive we then ordered are food starters and main the starter came quickly b ut half way throught the starter our main course came the the gire had to takle it back to the kitchen once the starter was finished the main came out at you could tell it was clearly left under a heat lamp because my stake which i asked for raw was almost well done so i think there was a bit of a  break down in communcation in the kitchen but we had our meal retired to some cosy seatws for a few more drinks.

the next morning after a really good nights sleep we wenty down to breakfast and have to say this was the saving grace the breakfast was amazing and coulnt be faulted in any way.

on summery this is a nice hotel if a little dated and in need of some work the staff were all very kind and helpfull and made our stay pleasant and i would recommend this hotel || Lovely hotel, definitely family resort. Kids loved swimming pool and daily kidos activities. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The buffet breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice. Including omelette or waffles. Staff supper friendly. We dined in the Library Bar on 2 nights and the food was delicious. I would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay again. || A gorgeous drive up and real handy and plentiful parking. Welcoming the moment you step in the door, there’s a big fire lighting and a gorgeous smell that draws you in. I had to ask the lovely receptionist what the candle was, so good!  Check in was really friendly, helpful and quick. room upstairs gorgeous, nice and quiet, really clean, really comfortable. We both booked spa treatments…. Unreal! Dinner was amazing, I had lasagna, my boyfriend had fish and chips. The service is fantastic and the staff are just lovely. Slept really well. Breakfast delicious, omg so much to choose from and lattes, flat whites whatever you want, the staff here amazing too. Honestly there is nothing negative I can say at all only that I didn’t want to leave! || We had a great night at the Brandon for my father’s birthday, 20 of us.  it’s been a while since I’d been but had heard from a few friends recently who were saying how lovely it was up there so we gave it a go. We were not disappointed, the food, the service, the atmosphere was really lovely. Warm and welcoming. We only booked last minute too but a lovely menu to suit all ages of the family was provided and a surprise birthday plate was organised for my dad.

There is a fridge in the room and a coffee machine that is also used for hot water for tea. One of the mugs in the room was very badly cracked right though and again at the handle although the receptionist replaced it immediately when I told her. The leisure centre is clean but the jacuzzi is tiny, 3 people can just about fit in it. It was recommended that we wore the robe and slippers provided to the leisure centre. There were robes but no slippers. The receptionist did give me two pairs when I asked. They were quite small, fine for me but didn't fit my husband's feet. We had dinner in the restaurant which was nice but I was disappointed the vegan steak wasn't available and when I asked if there were any other vegan options the waiter had to go check and then came back and said there was a vegan burger which was fine but I had no details about it, what was in it etc or even the price. The breakfast buffet had a good selection of food. Although quickly resolved, for the price you are paying, you would expect things like mugs not to be cracked and slippers to be provided (especially when it says you should use them going to the leisure centre) which is why they lose a star. But overall it's a nice place to stay and I would recommend. || Lovely spacious room, appointed to a good standard. Nice and clean as you hope for. A very warm welcome by the manager who is very pleasant, friendly - he is a real professional.
Topped off with a tasty dinner - top marks all around. I would definitely hope to stay again and certainly recommend the hotel. Well done Ravensport - wishing you long term success! || Just had dinner.  Chicken wings to start (€13) really tasty. Chicken Supreme with mash n loads of veg (€22), OMG so  delicious. Top marks chef. It's €7 for a pint of carlsberg (pricy I think).  Staff really friendly and hotel is really nice (if a little lacking in atmosphere).  Got a good deal on room price. Gym well equipped but small.  I was only one in it, so size was not an issue. Out of the way, ie 10km from wexford but here on business trip so ok for me..  I'd come again"

Would Highly recommend checking it out. || I have been a handful of times since it has been open - the different setting sets it apart. Nestled away, cosy enough that you’re surrounded by the woodlands, the greenery and the tranquility of it all. The sauna, the view, the cold plunges, to the showers and changing rooms. The ambience as the evening sets and the lights come on against the wooded decor.

The simplicity is effective.

The reception staff was so lovely and accommodating and my therapist Anna was super. Thoroughly enjoyed the treatment and the amenities before - it was raining when I was in the hot tub so felt really magical and cosy! Absolutely recommend 11/10. || Had the most lovely afternoon here for my massage! My friend and I were able to snag two appointments but one after the other, and the staff was so kind as to let us sit in the lounge to read our books! The massage was heavenly and I’m already plotting when I can be back! || Overall, our experience was underwhelming given the price paid, €185pp. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who appeared quite stressed and busy with opening the spa, which made the welcome feel a little rushed. Two guests warming themselves with a portable radiator caught my eye.

Unfortunately, some basic facilities were not up to standard. One of the toilet cubicles had no toilet paper, and the hand dryer was not working.

The sauna did not seem to heat properly. Although we were advised it would take some time to warm up, it never felt particularly hot during our visit.

The outdoor area was also disappointing. The jacuzzi appeared overly chlorinated; the strong vapour stung our eyes when we first entered. It also seemed to require a more thorough clean and general maintenance.

The highlight of our visit was the therapists who carried out the treatment. They were absolutely wonderful and truly made the experience for us, which is the main reason for the star rating given. However, the location of the changing rooms directly opposite the treatment rooms meant there was noticeable noise from showers, conversations, and hair dryers, which detracted from the otherwise relaxing atmosphere.

Lastly, we had to remind staff about the smoothie that was included upon departure. || I went to the rainforest spa on my own. I was the only one there at the time which was actually lovely. Saying that, if there was a lot of people attending I think the place would seem cramped. It’s small, staff are really nice. I will say the outside area is a bit underwhelming with only one hot tube.It did have a few leaves in it. But the view is nice.
Massage and reflexology with Kim was wonderful. Very informative.
The sign of the outside of the spa has a few letters missing which doesn’t give out a great first impression.
Also there are signs for the hotel when you turn but not the spa so initially I was a bit lost. Overall a good experience || Starting with the incredibly friendly Karen at the Rainforest Summerhill Hotel in Enniskerry, where I was greeted at the entrance with a warm smile and kind words, it was clear I was a welcome guest. Karen then explained in detail the services my wife and I could take advantage of. She arranged the hours as conveniently as possible so that my wife and I could arrive at the same time. Then came the massage itself, another new and incredible experience after what therapist Kim had offered. Overall, it was one of the best massages I've ever had. And the head massage was massage mastery at its finest... bravo, Kim, thank you. A beautiful place with an incredible view while enjoying the hot tub. The service and customer service, with empathy, warmth, and professionalism, definitely encourage me to return, which we certainly will. A 5+ rating for the place... a 6+ rating for the staff. Thank you and best regards.

The service was excellent, the massages great (Georgina and Niall are worth a mention), afternoon tea was tasty, and the setting and value itself are just made for relaxation. Even on a busy bank holiday weekend, the Spa itself did not seem busy at all.

I cant wait to go back || Treatment and therapist were fantastic - had a lovely massage, however, the booking process and communications re same were quite shambolic and there is a huge sense of disorganisation. In addition, my treatment time was moved so I could have a female therapist but then when I arrived, they tried to give me a male therapist again and as a result of all the faffing, the massage wasn’t a full hour. Finally, they gave me a champagne flavoured sorbet afterwards which is a very strange flavour choice for a wellness spa and even more bizarre for pregnant women - this was the only flavour they served and should be changed to something non alcoholic. || We had the most amazing spa experience in Powerscourt spa. I had the maternity massage and it was so relaxing. The food was delicious too. Would highly recommend || Brilliant spa. Would highly recommend for both males and females looking for a VERY relaxed and pampered experience, whether staying in the hotel or not.
Booking any treatments also gets you access to the ESPA's other spa facilities, so you can really make the most of your time there. If just getting nails or other small treatments, you have access to the upstairs thermal facilities. Or if having a massage, etc then you can also avail of the spa's pool and jacuzzi downstairs.
The staff are lovely and always very friendly. Arrive a little early for your appointment to ensure you have time to be given a tour so you know where everything is and make the most of your ""you"" time. || Great service, great staff. Nice place for a break. Spa experience is very professional. Afternoon tea in the spa cafe is served with good quality."

Can understand if true investment was being made in the gym but that is not to be seen. Current price it is at you are better to go to another gym with superior facilities."

It was truly money well spent. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back! || Amazing service and quality of work.
Have to admit that probably one of the best quality manicure I had in a long time.

The space feels modern and well thought out — plenty of room to move, good equipment, and clean facilities. The layout lets you work out without feeling cramped, which is a big plus.

Staff are friendly and professional, and they seem genuinely invested in helping members. You don’t feel like just another number — there’s a human touch. The location is also very convenient: easy to get to, close to amenities, which makes it practical for dropping in before or after work.

If you’re looking for a gym that balances quality, service, and ease, Iconic Health Clubs delivers well. || I’m genuinely happy with my experience at Iconic Health Clubs Smithfield.

Special thanks to Ilayda for her support, attentiveness, and helpful attitude.🌸🕊️ || Guys trust me & the other bad reviews you see.. This place is a cesspool. The 3 month notice in cancellation is absolutely appalling. The staff? They are not friendly they are fake. Big difference. The place is not worth the price they ask for. I spent over 8 months in this gym. Many times I ran into issues mainly around staff who wore just very arrogant for no reason. Or very ""Oh look at me I'm the boss"" if you're aware of body language & people in general. You'll understand exactly what I mean. This gym for what they charge is a total rip off. If this gym cost 30€ a month it would have 4 stars. But at 120€ a month & you have to give a 3 month notice to cancel. 1 star. The price & the experience is completely off. Dont make the same mistakes. Look for a better gym. || Excellent, gym! I love very much. Creative and energetic classes, incredible teachers. All perfect. The best gym for sure!"

Great location and staff, I have only used the pool area but the gym also seems very well equipped. I'm leaving a star for basicly nitpicks, things can always improve, my main one is it's a shame there is no deep end of the pool as it's pretty shallow to begin with. || I really like Club Vitae – the gym, pool, and sauna are great, and the staff are always kind and helpful.

The only thing that makes me feel uncomfortable is the female changing room. Quite often, women bring their sons inside, and sometimes they look around 10–11 years old. Honestly, I don’t think that’s normal, and I can see that the boys also feel awkward. For example, once I came back from the pool and a boy was getting changed – when he noticed me, he looked so shy and ran away.

Maybe it would be a good idea to create a separate changing area for kids? That would make things easier for everyone. || Very nice gym facilities in the centre of Dublin. Lots of equipment to suit all requirement and enough equipment to cope with busy times. There are also scheduled fitness classes that are available for hotel guests too. All equipment, pool and changing facilities were very clean. || Nice gym
It has a lot of equipment and a great swimming pool. || Joined the gym during the summer. The gym itself is big, clean and quiet - no complaints. The gym membership offers pool access which is the reason I chose this gym and my training would be mostly swimming. However, every time I have gone since the start of September, there are two of the three lanes closed off at peak times (4 to 6pm weekdays, all day Sundays) for swimming lessons, leaving all the adult paying members to swim on top of each other or have no access at all. In retrospect I would not have chosen a membership here if I knew my pool access would be so limited and am disappointed no staff member made this clear to me before I committed to a membership. Also during lesson times parents leave their children in the small women's changing room on their devices and headphones as they have nowhere else to go which is unfair on adult women trying to use these small facilities at peak times. The gym definitely favours parents of children doing swimming lessons not it's adult members. Am unsure if we will continue our membership at this time."

I went there maybe 2-3 years ago and it was nice.
On this occasion, it was not relaxing!
1- the receptionist needs to work on her manners and speak clearly, know how to welcome clients etc.
2- Toilets and sink are dirty with some blood on the floor.
3- Been taken 10-12 minutes late despite arriving before time (8 minutes before my appointment). My appointment was cut short.
4 - My therapist was lovely but treatment wasn't good - massage was too soft despite asking for a strong one.
5 - Indian head massage - absolutely nothing of a head massage.
6- I was in the room next to the reception so could hear everything.
7- After the treatment, you should be relaxing but you just end up seating in the reception.
Don't think I will be back if there's no improvement. || I had an amazing experience!❤️the Staff are so friendly
Lovely atmosphere. Priyanka was amazing! I’m definitely coming back || Disappointing experience. The place looks shabby and definitely lacks cleanliness. When entering the building and going up the stairs it is evident the carpet has not been hoovered in a while. I arrived 10 min early for my morning appointment as asked but the reception room was unattended and in the dark as clearly I was the first arrived. Do not pay attention to the polished website as the place itself does not reflect the website. The massage was also disappointing. The therapist clearly has not been trained in Indian Head Massage. The massage strokes were repetitive to the point it was annoying.The massage table felt hard and not comfortable. || I had the 90-minute Coconut Massage with Priyanka and it was genuinely the best massage I have ever had. The pressure was perfect, the movements were incredibly relaxing, and Priyanka was so kind and attentive throughout. The different oils and products, the calming music, and the peaceful atmosphere made the whole experience truly special.

The only point of improvement would be the massage table, which was a bit narrow and not the most comfortable. However, the quality of the massage and the care shown far outweighed this. I also really appreciated the complimentary drink offered at the end.

This was a Groupon booking and it was quite difficult to get an appointment (I had to wait over two months as there were no available slots), but it was absolutely worth the wait.

Thank you so much, Priyanka, I will definitely be back! || This review highlights my experience and confirms the issue that is mentioned in almost all reviews.

Booked and paid for a treatment package with Dawson spa in the hope of having a relaxing time however it turned out to be a nightmare!
Booked my treatments about a month prior only for the business to call me 5 hours prior to the appointment to cancel it due to staff not being available.
As the only solution I was offered was rescheduling, I told them I would call back to schedule a new date as their call was during a work lunch and I was assured that there are availabilities at any time.
(I called back an hour later, a day later, 2 days later, a week later, two weeks later Multiple times, leaving a voice message to be called back as no one answered however there was still no answer nor call back).
I finally sent an email explaining the situation, and after multiple back and forth emails that took days, I was offered an upgrade on my package yet STILL no booking nor a question about it.

I then communicated that I am still trying to get a booking and that is the main issue.
I was asked to send dates that would be available and so I did however still no reply. I decided to go into town that Morning to the business itself and speak to them in person in the hopes that this will be sorted! Staff then told me to send an email and their manager will contact me!!! I proceeded in explaining my situation so they asked me to leave a phone number to be contacted by the manager (Maureen) once she is back.
Although I had already shared my contact information via email with her, I did that again with the staff and left. I finally received a call at 7:30pm that day to tell me that there is no availability for another FIVE Weeks.

THE TREATMENT:

The Massage was OK. I cannot say that it was bad however it certainly was not good.

The Facial was decent. I actually think that the products that were used and the technique were good.

The head massage was not good and I personally found it to be annoying as I specifically asked twice for no oils/creams to be used on my scalp/hair for medical reasons however my request was completely ignored which is very ignorant.

CONCLUSION:
I am not sure I would recommend this place as there are multiple other, much professional options in this price range."

I only wish I had booked the 90 minute session. The building itself is a bit old as many are in Dublin but it is very clean and well maintained. I have tried many massage places around Dublin but this is definitely one I will keep coming back to whenever I am in town. || It was amazing today to be in thai massage I love it definitely I will be back || I walked into Thai Healing Massage with the posture of a question mark and the stress level of someone who just tried to parallel park in Temple Bar. I walked out floating like a lotus blossom on a serene pond… that had just done CrossFit for the first time in years.

From the moment I stepped inside, the ambiance wrapped around me like a warm cup of herbal tea—tranquil lighting, soft music, and the gentle scent of lemongrass that whispered, “You’re safe now, my child.”

My therapist was a magician. I don’t say that lightly. She found knots in my back I think were passed down genetically. There were moments I wasn’t sure if I was getting a massage or being gently folded into origami—but somehow, it all made sense. She was strong, intuitive, and had the rare gift of knowing exactly when to go deep and when to let me breathe. At one point, I think I saw my past life flash before me… and it had better posture.

This is not your average rub-and-go. This is a healing experience, conducted with precision, grace, and the kind of care that makes you want to text your ex and forgive them (I didn’t—but I thought about it).

Whether you’re a weary traveler, a stressed-out Dubliner, or just someone whose body feels like it’s been slept on by a herd of goats, Thai Healing Massage is the reset button you didn’t know you needed. 10 out of 10 — would contort again. || Amazing place to do a Thai message! Got there completely stressed and left floating. Thank you for your kindness || I went today for a deep tissue massage, and it was amazing. The ladie was so nice and she worked very well on my body. I was surprised by the way she handled me. I will definitely go again.

The class was appropriate for beginners, and I appreciated the music and studio lighting, which added a nice touch to the overall atmosphere.

However, the studio felt overcrowded, with too many reformer machines placed very close together, making the space feel quite claustrophobic. The small base of the reformer machines also made some exercises uncomfortable and difficult to perform properly. For this type of service, I was expecting a more spacious and comfortable setup.

Unfortunately, the reception experience was disappointing.

He also took time to recommend various supplemental protein options tailored to my exercise routine, which was so lovely and welcoming.

The studio itself is beautifully designed with a sleek, modern aesthetic and spotlessly clean facilities. They provide thoughtful amenities like towels and cleats to enhance your workout comfort.

Highly recommended for students, athletes, and anyone looking for a premium fitness environment in Cork! || I signed up for the gym and pool 5 days ago and paid almost €200 upfront for a 3-month membership. Before joining, I clearly asked at reception if members could use the pool even when lessons were running, and I was told yes, as the pool would be divided.

On Saturday (31/01), I brought my 4-year-old daughter to swim. We arrived at 11am and both pools were being used for lessons. I checked again with reception and was told, once more, that we could use the pool.
After getting changed, a pool staff member was extremely rude and told us to leave immediately, saying the children’s pool would be used. I explained calmly that it was my first day and that reception had confirmed we could use half of the pool. He rolled his eyes, spoke rudely, said there would be a break at 11:30 and that we could not stay, then walked away, leaving me speaking alone. We were basically kicked out.
While getting ready to leave, I briefly took my phone out of the locker to put it in my pocket. Another pool staff member, again very rude, almost shouted at me saying I was not authorised to use a phone in the pool area. When I tried to explain, he turned his back on me and walked away, embarrassing me in front of other people.
The overall feeling was that I was there for free and staff were doing me a favour .which is not true. I paid in advance and, as a first-time user, I expected clear guidance and basic respect.
I had to pay extra 15 Euros in other pool in the city,  where I was treated like member, with friendly staffs !!!

If I could get my money back and never return, I would. Unfortunately, I am now locked into a 3-month membership. || Good facilities however very unfriendly staff. I thought it was just my opinion but after speaking to other members it seems to be a lot of people’s opinions. The staff only interact with the elderly members and won’t even smile or say hello to anyone else. You’re far more likely to get a dirty look from them. There miserable and extremely unapproachable especially the man with long hair. Other gyms there is more of a sense of community and friendliness from staff however not this one. || They posted posters everywhere about so called renovations that cost millions of euros and caused disturbance and disruption on entry exit, car park, and facilities for so long. Yet there is no visible improvement at all.  Just this week the car park was flooded. Machines are all rusty and always at least one is broken waiting for service. One specific receptionist is always rude to anyone I witness she has interactions including her colleagues. The only ok thing is the price but seems like they will increase because of the way they keep claiming they are investing on so called improvements… || One of a highlight owned by University College Cork. Adjoining a soccer/rugby ground and a hockey turf pitch. Mardyke is a great center which includes swimming, basketball, gym, badminton, squash , steam , sauna and many more activities.

Shortly thereafter, the same man blocked my wife in the ""swim only"" lane and began staring at her in that predatory way a person does if they're trying to threaten you. The same manager was told about this. He said he saw this incident on the CCTV. And... that was it. They shruggingly agreed that a person shoudln't act that way. And they did nothing. The man was not removed, no assurances were given my wife about how threatening behavior would be dealt with in the pool, nothing.

Two days later, having heard nothing from anyone working at the pool, we cancelled our memberships. As my wife said, she feels unsafe in the pool. Of course she does. A large adult male acted threateningly towards her, and attacked her husband, and no action was taken.

This is ""law of the jungle"" stuff. I have a three year old who comes with us. He's our main reason for being there. It is not appropriate for me to get into a fight with a strange adult male who is looking for a fight and threatening women because management is imposing no standards of safety or care for its members.

The one thing I asked for was a refund for the remainder of our month's subscription. That's it.

That was ten days ago. And I haven't heard anything back.

This is one of those situaitons where people are acting in such a wild manner that you question your own sanity based on how it has been handled. I feel extremely angry at the total lack of care in how we have been treated, and that this hooligan is being enabled as he goes around acting however he wants in a place as particualrly requiring of care and safety as a swimming pool.

Two employees of the pool told us after the fact that they had seen this person's behavior before and indicated that these incidents with us were in line with his character.

Wild. || Fabulous place to take the kids for a little swim day. Warm water and fun slides || An excellent facility to have. Lots of changing rooms. The place is continually cleaned during the day which is great in such a busy pool. Very family friendly. Cool music playing. || Been here twice and they are really helpful. They helped me find the gym and showed me what equipment was best for beginners and to get to my goal. They always wear a smile when I come in and is happy to help. 11/10. Found my gym/pool. They are accomadating to disabilities moth physical and mental. I have a busted knee and asd and they helped me around those and didn't dumb things down for me. Great for people starting out or like me haven't gone swimming in a while || I have been here so many times I don't think I can count. I've taken some lessons here a few years ago and I actually got pretty good at swimming. I come here on weekends and it's not hard to get booked but it really depends on how much people are with you in my opinion 3 is a good size. The thing about the pool is that the medium one is way to small because it could be pretty packed with kids and adults and I recommend going into the biggest pool because it's more free even though the water is kind of cold it's super fun. Now the smallest pool isn't so bad it's actually good especially for babies or if you just want to go on the tire swing or just go down the slide, the water in there is warm but a perfect kind of warm but that's probably because it's more shallow and smaller. Now for the big pool there isn't much toys and Im not sure where to find them but I guess im supposed to ask staff. Also an issue I have is kids staying wayy to long in the pool, I hate to admit this but I've done it before I stayed an extra hour and 30 minutes before I decided to leave and when I did staff just kept watching the pool (which is obviously a good thing) but I don't think they realized I stayed for pretty long. Overall I love this swimming centre and the swimming classes so this deserves 5 stars."

Beth and Billy, in particular, are two incredible young people. They make you feel welcome and are always in great form.
They know when to be courteous and professional and when to have the craic. I always look forward to going in to the pool/gym, and if either Beth or Billy are working, it's a bonus. The gym/pool facilities are great, but it is the staff of this great Leisure Centre that make it 5 Star. || Its not a bad gym by any means but they are a lot of gyms in cork with more equipment and which cost less. €55 is very pricy and the €35 admin fee is a joke considering joining takes 10 minutes and is entirely online with no human interaction. Also they don't allow people to charge their devices on the sockets in the gym which seems cheap. Might be worth it if you are interested in swimming but if that is not the case there are a lot of better options in cork. || Great gym for value. The gym is getting a face-lift at the moment. The staff at the front desk are extremely competent and friendly.  The locker rooms are decent and the cleaners are constantly going around. You can pay more somewhere else and receive a lot less. || Staff are brilliant especially Shane and Dylan, always available for any issues, gym is perfect for all types of level's.

I have been going here for about 7 months now and i really enjoy it , only thing that bothered me is that it gets extremely full at times but you can still get a good workout in within an hour which is what id say is the average time for me.
There is tons of space for extra activites like boxing, which is what i primarily do and i find it comfortable to train there.
People are pretty friendly but sometimes i would look out for some men that may be anti-social, but apart from that the gym is very well equipped and staff is very friendly.
I would recommened it. || During my stay at Ireland we 2 families with children went there to hangout …. The ambience was really nice… there were many attractions for children in game zone… we specially went for bowling - they had an offer to have one hour group bowling in just 45 euro…. It was fun playing bowling with everyone … very nice and kids friendly place. Those who love to grab a hard drink - for them there was dedicated bar counter too. || Excellent gym. Great staff. The new sauna is a brilliant addition.  Would be useful to have a scales in the mens changing room if possible || Not a bad gym. It’s annoying how many users feel the need to film and photograph themselves in the public changing rooms - also illegal, specially considering many underage people use the gym and people should expect privacy. || Used this gym for the week whilst I was working at Galway Races - excellent spot 🙌

It's not clean, staff are unfriendly and defensive when you complain. Just look at some of the dreadful responses to reviews on here! Gym floor very untidy and not clean and rarely any staff around.  Machine seats ripped and many not working properly.  Every bathroom has mould around sinks etc.  Hairs in all showers, no soap, no moisturiser, no spinner for swim trunks. Lack of hooks in changing rooms. Over subscribed and used mainly by overseas students probably because they get a heavy discount.  Booking system haphazard.  Lockers not cleaned, swimming pool not clean with discoloured tiles and always foreign objects in water.  Sauna and steam smell bad and neither hot enough.  Disgrace for a university gym, go elsewhere, even Leisureland is better || The gym is a very unpleasant place. It’s very messy, and has no A/C or appropriate ventilation. The air feels unbreathable and whenever the temperature is slightly higher it’s just impossible to workout. They only have one fan and it’s stationed outside the main workout area for some reason.
Edit: there was no AC on in the main gym area upstairs and when I asked the staff to turn it on they said there was no AC available || Great sport complex and gym. It has a lot of training machines and weights/dumbbells, treadmills, etc. During the academic year, it could become very crowded in the mornings (before classes start) and after 5 pm (when classes end). Other issues are machines becoming out of order frequently and being repaired very slowly and not having some machines like chest fly, back fly or any decline benches. || Prices have increased from €10 to €12 for pay as you to use the pool. No problem with that if the pool area was well maintained but there are a number of issues that havent been catered for such as; hooks missing from cubicles, doors difficult to lock; no complimentary shampoo in shower and bathrooms/flooring is always filty; some lockers broken.

The environment is extremely cold, especially early in the morning. I work out every day at 5:30 a.m., and even after the membership fee increase, comfort has not been taken into consideration.

People who train early are looking for a pleasant and comfortable environment, not a freezing one that affects both performance and well-being. The gym should adjust the air conditioning to maintain a more comfortable temperature, particularly during the early morning hours.

I hope this issue will be reviewed, as it makes a real difference for daily members. || What you see is what you get: a solid gym with plenty of equipment that's in good repair. They do Day Passes for €10 too, without the need for a member to be with you. Gabby at reception was very helpful. I'll definitely be back when next in town. 👌 || I do not recommend this place to work your body, the place smells bad, is dark , it is like a box with people all together, and the manager is very smart to take your money, If I were the owner I would fire this manager, they debited me 40 euros in 4 days when it was canceled without having used their dirty facilities. Do not debit your fee here because they are very fast with money. CHOOSE ANOTHER GYM WITH A POOL AND SAUNA AND YOU WILL PAY THE SAME AS IN THIS SMELLY AND DARK PLACE, they have debited my money in advance. I hate places like these. || Really amazing gym. Got a day pass for 9 euro, the staff were super friendly, one of the lost well equipped gyms I've ever seen, and they also have good facilities (showers /hair dryers).

I might need some lessons myself to keep up 😆 || I highly recommend individual swimming lessons with Marin.

Joined up back in October,  great staff, very knowledgeable and friendly. Members say hello to eachother unlike many other places. Machines are a bit dated but safe and maintained, no issue. Plenty of free weights and saunas in each dressing room. || Went here just with a day pass, it was €10 which is the standard but the gym was class. Has a great selection of machines and free weights despite its small area and is perfect if you are into traditional bodybuilding. Dressing rooms were perfect and had a sauna which was ideal after the workout. Jason at the front desk was sound and answered any questions I had, would come back here again no problem! || Best gym I have ever been in. I was traveling from the United States and wanted to find a real gym for those who are dedicated to fitness. I walked in the door and was greeted by John. He showed me around and was very kind and helpful. The equipment is everything you would need if you are having bodybuilding or strongmen aspirations. Very cheap day passes! I can't say enough good things about this place! || We visited Galway City Gym twice during our short holiday, and it’s a classic old-school gym with everything you could possibly need for a great workout. The gym is fully equipped, and the staff were absolutely amazing—so friendly and welcoming! I highly recommend this gym to anyone looking to stay active while visiting Galway. A wonderful place to keep up with your fitness routine! || Great Gym, has all the equipment you need for a well rounded session. Also a very nice Sauna for relaxation and recovery. The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere of the gym floor is fantastic."
