Everything was really well done and the sauna felt amazing. Left feeling refreshed and chilled out. Highly recommend and will definitely be back! || amazing experience!! incredibly relaxing environment and super clean facilities as well. great decor too!

first time at a sauna and already ready to come back! || Beautiful sauna experience here! Always clean and friendly people working there. Location is amazing and lovely food court and pub just outside too || I had high expectations based on all the glowing reviews but unfortunately, my experience didn’t quite match the hype. Don’t get me wrong, the female staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, creating a great first impression and making you want to return. However, whoever is managing the overall operations needs to reassess the maximum capacity.

With nine people crammed into a hot sauna, it felt overcrowded and uncomfortable. Reducing the limit to seven would make a significant difference. The decor and rustic nature-inspired ambiance were well done, but the experience was dampened by the noise level. In the pod we chose, a group was talking loudly, laughing, and shouting which wasn’t the relaxing atmosphere I had hoped for, especially for my first sauna experience (in Ireland).

To make matters worse, when two people left for the plunge baths, seating naturally shifted due to the tight space. When they returned, one of them expected his original spot to still be available and tried to squeeze in, making another guest visibly uncomfortable to the point that she got up and left. His reaction was ‘I didn’t do anything’. 🚩🚩🚩🚩 This situation only highlighted the issue with the overcrowding in these pods.

My partner enjoyed it more once the crowd thinned out after this incident - but for me, it was enough to put me off returning. I did notice they offer Silent Nights and Ladies’ Nights, and I imagine a Silent Night would be a much better option for those seeking a peaceful experience. A safety factor that could be considered in the future are safety toggles, wrapped around the wrist when pressed it alerts the staff to check the pod out. ⚠️ something to ponder on of course. || Always a great experience here. Sauna is nice and hot, plunge is nice and cold. Friendly helpful staff. The barrel sauna has a high enough ceiling that the heat is pleasant. Stop for a coffee and a treat in Pan Eile in the courtyard when you are done. Rafa will look after you."

Big down side was no changing areas, no sheltered area at all, and one portaloo. It wasnt raining heavily when we were finished up and trying to change out of swim gear, changing out in the open in rain is not ideal. Would be nice to have a small bit of privacy when changing in front of lots of strangers, yikes.
Walk from local car park, so access to car is 5 minute walk away.
Will return, but will allow for lack of changing area. || Great view and setting overlooking the ocean! The wood fired sauna is lovely and big. I didn't try the plunge barrel but the two ice baths are lovely and clean. Great spot for groups or individuals. || Highly recommend visiting the Wood Fired Sauna in Rush.

Each session is 45 minutes which gives you enough time for 3 sauna/plunge cycles. There are 2 ice baths, a barrel plunge, and a private path to the Rush North Beach for when the tide is in.

Fresh running water available and changing rooms are nearby. || Highly recommend this place, fabulous experience, totally invigorating and relaxing at the same time! Always have the best night's sleep after a visit to the Wood Fired Sauna. || Brilliant sauna located in an amazing spot just off Rush North Beach. The sauna is always pipping hot and the staff are lovely. Amazing way to spend a fun and active weekend or just to relax after work on a weekday afternoon. The freezing cold ice baths offer well needed recovery whilst the sauna offers a spot to meet new people and sweat it out!"

One suggestion,time went too fast,maybe time could be extended to 1h :) || Really nice setup, two large saunas, multiple cold plunge barrels, a cold plunge pool at 3 degrees, and a hot tub. Coffee dock with some nice pastries too, and a really relaxed atmosphere - i really enjoyed this place - 100% recommend 👌 || Lovely sauna / plunge / hot tub experience. All the staff were so helpful, was my first time there so was really nice of them to take the time to show us around. Will definitely be back again || Stopped by for some coffee and treats. Did not try the sauna. Service was excellent and coffee was delicious. The croissant was a ok, probably would try something different next time. Lovely location in a nice day! || 31st Finnish sauna review. These saunas are both great. Temperature was a minimum of 90c entire time, ranging up to 110c. Wood fired was 110c down to 90c, electric was a flat 105c. Humidity was 10% in both.

IMO the ash pan in the wood fired stove was kept open way too long and a bunch of the heat was being lost as the timber was being burnt through too often, leading to inconsistency.

Feedback to help with the culture; tell people when they attend to go in/out quickly and don’t keep the door open. Too many people didn’t seem to know about the importance of the door lot of good heat was lost.

The bucket and ladle in the electric sauna could/should be upgraded from plastic to wooden - hot plastics are bad.

The bench height in the electric sauna was perfect, law of löyly maintained. Also the first time seeing the rounded rocks in person. They do give off a smoother löyly, which is lovely. That combination has that experience being one of the most perfect saunas I’ve visited. With the rocks hot as they were the lämpömassa was on point, unlike others. This was a sauna I didn’t want to leave. The wood fired sauna’s temperature was variable based on how the fire was being fed, combined with the ash pan being open and it was a bit more hit and miss. Combined that with sitting a bit lower (law of löyly not observed) and it didn’t quite pack the same punch. Still a good experience, but not next level like the electric. The electric was the star of the show! Both heaters were Harvia heaters so quality.

The cold plunges were spot on, the coldest bath felt close to 0c and there was around 4-5 other baths with different temperatures.

Would love a warm shower to heat up afterwards before heading out, but that doesn’t take away from the experience. Will be back when next in Dublin. Thank you!"

The other patrons there are also lovely and enjoying the facilities. If you’re feeling adventurous, the coldest plunge is definitely your only question! || First time visiting here the other day and I will definitely be back! The space is big enough to cater to quite a large group of people without it feeling over crowded. The saunas and women’s changing areas were really clean and well kept, and they have a dryer for your bathing suit which is so handy!! One of the saunas also had a eucalyptus scent which was gorgeous. || It was my our second time to be here and it gets better and better. It was a fine sunny weather, but it made the experience better. We were able to maximize all the saunas, nice temperature. Clean facilities, nice staff, very cozy environment. Will definitely be back. || Absolutely 5 stars for Hot Box Inchicore! I've been to a lot of saunas, but this one is hands down the best. The variety of sauna styles is incredible — there's even a silent sauna which I loved for total relaxation. The three different plunge pools are amazing: one icy cold, one mild, and one that feels like a hot tub – perfect for whatever vibe you’re after. The place is spotless, so well maintained, and the staff are genuinely some of the friendliest I’ve met. You can really tell they care. Highly recommend for anyone looking to unwind, reset, and feel amazing after! || Fantastic location with 5 different saunas and a walk-in plunge pool. The saunas are a mix of wood fire and electric and there’s a silent sauna for some peace and quiet. Facilities are were very clean and the staff are really friendly. Would highly recommend!

Matthew, the lad working there, was absolutely lovely super friendly and really helpful throughout. The dressing rooms were private and well-kept and the saunas themselves were modern and comfortable. Loved the setup with the three plunge pools at 4°C, 6°C, and 8°C perfect for a proper cold exposure session!

A couple of tips: bring a towel to sit on in the sauna and there’s free parking on-site which is a big plus. Highly recommend for anyone looking to unwind and recharge. || 2nd sauna to review in Dublin!

Welcome to Fad Saoil, the sauna home of BMO running club! I was introduced to the sauna because I signed up for the run club’s long run series (and recovery thereafter) in preparation for the Dublin Marathon 2025.

So overall, Fad Saoil is pretty decent for a sauna place. They have 2 hot boxes (1 normal and 1 for silent sauna), 3 cold plunge tub with 3 different temperatures, shower area, changing rooms and a toilet. Fad Saoil can accommodate 16 pax per time slot.

I would say that it is a good value for money both for sauna members and non-members and they have packages for frequent visitors.

Staffs are so nice and accommodating but I won’t suggest to do walk-ins though as Fad Saoil gets busy too. Make sure you book online before visiting. 😂

Definitely visiting again!🙂 || Hands down the best sauna experience I’ve had in Dublin, I was introduced to the place by the BMO running club and have since became a regular both for recovery after runs and just to relax.

The staff is amazing and the vibe is so friendly and welcoming that it feels like someone’s living room. The location is ideal as well when it’s easy to get to (and also accessible to go for a run before your session).

I’m from Finland and grew up going to the sauna several times a week. Since moving to Dublin almost four years ago the thing I miss most has been a proper sauna - with the proper heat, cold plunge and atmosphere to go with it. So glad I finally found this place! || Small, but good setup & clean. 2 saunas on site & 3 cold plunges. This was my first time going there & it didn’t disappoint. There are numerous changing booths but no lockers for your belongings, only shelves to store them on. Would be great to see them get some lockers there for safe storage down the line. Picked up a sauna hat from them for 15 quid on the way out which I will be using on my next visit! || Cute little ""grotto"" tucked in the hustling and bustling of Rathmines.

The saunas are fantastic, they heat up very quick, especially the silent sauna, which you can essentially burn your ears off if you so choose to.

the plunge pool or plunge pods or whatever you want to call them are also really nice, although I wouldn't mind having a larger communal plunge so more people could join.

overall this is a great concept and honestly a fantastic setup that you can have great meetups or experiences with your friends and co-workers or whatever!

also if you can bring your own drinks so that's pretty cool.

I would absolutely go here again, and definitely recommend any of their locations.
apparently their greystones location has a scenery to die for, so I will be checking that out due to my great experience here!

thanks again!"

Highly recommend to anyone—whether you come alone or with others. ✨ || What a great experience! The sauna itself offered beautiful views, and there were even cold water barrels outside for a refreshing dip. Just a heads-up, no phones are allowed inside.
The changing room is open to all, so definitely come prepared with your swimsuit under your clothes. Afterwards, there's a coffee truck right outside for drinks and snacks, which is super convenient."" || We went to the Sea Sauna for the first time today and would highly recommend it! Location is stunning, there’s a lovely cliff walk with gorgeous views,a quiet beach great for swimming and a llthe carriage truck that does great food and coffee!

The sea sauna set-up itself is great- a really clever use of what is a small space, looking forward to seeing it expanded in the future!

Robin, the staff member on-site was fantastic, super knowledgeable, approachable and friendly which was great for us as non-regular sauna users! She was really on-top of keeping the saunas, plunge barrels and showers clean and at the right temps!

The box sauna itself was really enjoyable, clean, spacious and at a consistent temp. The view is the best I’ve seen from a Dublin sauna! The showers and plunge barrels are well located, and although they can be busy we didn’t ever have to queue for more than 2 minutes for either.

The beach is a 3/4 minute walk away and is a lovely swim spot. There are a good few steps down and *lots* of seaweed on the shoreline but still, a fantastic place to go in between sauna sessions!

Lovely chill place to spend a Saturday morning/ afternoon and we will absolutely be back! || I had a wonderful experience at the sauna.
The staff were really friendly, especially Robin she was exceptionally kind and helpful. The atmosphere was relaxing. I can definitely recommend this place. || Fantastic place, really relaxing. Amazing views from the sauna. Owners keep them very clean and are super helpful, highly recommended."

The team is genuinely kind and attentive and it's very clean. The sauna is super hot and feels amazing, and the ice baths are sharp, refreshing, and incredibly revitalizing. Can't wait to come back! || Great Sauna in Dublin and lovely welcome from the owner. If you are looking for resourceful and healthy activities to do the weekend. That’s the things to do after your working week :) Quality and social spa. || I've visited twice. The facilities are cozy, and the sauna maintains a comfortable temperature of 90–100°C. However, the plunge pool area is limited, only three baths, which isn't sufficient when there are 6 to 8 people. The 45-minute session feels too short for plunging, as you often have to wait your turn. Also, there are no essential oils in the water buckets, which is a missed opportunity, especially since most saunas in Ireland overlook this detail. || Fabulous sauna.

And the cherry on top: every two hours they host different sauna rituals, which makes the experience even more special and immersive. We absolutely loved it. We’ve already been three times in January, brought friends along, even bought a gift voucher for my nephew — and we’re planning to get a membership for ourselves too.

Safe to say, we’re beyond happy with this place. Highly, highly recommended! || Great central location, pristine state of the art facilities and super friendly staff. I stayed for one of the guided ritual sessions and it was absolutely fantastic, you can tell the guides are really passionate about what they do. Will definitely be back || Wow is all I can say after experiencing the new facility at Bolands Mill. I took part in one of the rituals with a guest expert from New York and it really took the experience to a new level. I slept so well last night. It is a bit more expensive than the other saunas but you get so much more - complimentary herbal teas, cold water, towels and to top it all a hot shower afterwards with amazing shampoo/conditioner and body wash and then Dyson hairdryers . Cannot recommend highly enough. Keep up the good work lads || Had an amazing experience at Hot Box Sauna, Boland Mills. The sauna ritual with Otis was the highlight — expertly guided, calming, and incredibly restorative. Otis creates such a welcoming, focused atmosphere and clearly knows his craft.

The facilities are excellent: modern, spotless, and very well maintained, with cleanliness at a really high standard throughout.

Brilliant value for money for the quality of the experience. Highly recommend and will definitely be back 🔥🧖‍♀️ || An absolutely brilliant experience. Special mention to Otis and Maria. Maria’s aufguss ritual was exceptional, honestly worth the visit for that alone.

Fair play, though — it works wonders!
The sauna? Always roasting — hotter than a Dublin bus in July, I swear. Sit in there for five minutes and you’ll be sweating out sins you didn’t even know you had.

Dan, the man himself — sound as a pound. Always up for a chat, keeps the place spotless, and makes everyone feel welcome.

Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique and revitalizing wellness experience! || I would love to give this place a 5 star but I cant.
It really is a little oasis and they have set it up wonderfully, and it looks great in every aspect BUT they need to work on the temperatures of their sauna's. The two wood fired saunas were over 120 degrees when i went in, and you could barely breathe. So then I tried the electric ones, and one was only 40 degrees, and the other was a perfect 80 degrees but when I tried to sit down the wood was so hot it burnt me. I dont know why, I think they may have used the wrong wood in this sauna? Because ive never experienced that before, and ive been to a lot of saunas. I even tried with my towel, but wherever I touched the wood it was like seriously burning so I couldn't relax. I told the staff but they didnt seem to care, and just offered me a towel. Which made me wonder why I'd been using my towel and hadn't been offered one from the start if they had towels for customers.
I ended up going back to the wood fired one, leaving the door open till the temperature came back down below 100 and this was quite nice, but overall not the relaxing experience you want from a sauna.
The place looks fantastic and the ice baths are an awesome touch, and by all accounts the place should have been packed, yet there were maybe 2 other people here, which begs the question why?
Also in the whole hour or longer I was in the sauna (which started out at over 120 degrees) the staff did not check or do a single round to see if people were ok? There were two of them just sitting there chatting and I think maybe their time would have been spent better checking on the saunas and ensuring the temperatures were kept within a certain range.
The idea is great, the place itself is great and you've almost got an amazing experience, but temperature is so important in a sauna, and you need to work on yours a bit. If you fix that, you'll have a wonderful place ✨️
Also do not like the plastic water bottles. If you're going to operate a sauna a water bottle refill station is a non negotiable! || So pleased to have this gem of a spot so local to us. Impressive set-up of an array of wood-fired and electric sauna options, different temp. cold plunges and crucially proper shower facilities for after. 10/10. Love visiting Sallynoggin Saunas! || The experience is incredible. If you’re thinking about coming, just come it’s absolutely worth it.

Next visit I used the sauna on the left which doesn’t seem to be as hot or else there wasn’t as much wood on the stove.

The lake is very refreshing for a dip.

Review edit July2025: the experience you get really depends on who is working, I went last week at 7pm and when I got in the fire was out and I had to ask the person working to relight it. 20 minutes of the 1 hour session spent heating the sauna up from scratch. Probably won’t use it as much as it is unreliable compared to other local saunas where the fires are tended to frequently. || I loved my time down at the Sauna Snug. Firstly it was so peaceful and has a beautiful view of the lake. Secondly the Sauna was at a really warm temperature 🌡️ not too hot but not to tepid. Then to be able to take a nice short walk down to the lake and jump in, and it was freezing 🥶, like crazy cold which obviously feels amazing.
There just something about the Sauna Snug that works I'm sure when you go down and try it you'll know what I mean.
I've been to other Sauna places where you can feel how wellness and saunas are being used in Ireland to replace traditional social settings, you can feel how they're set up to make money, and you feel rushed. Even though I came to relax but at the Sauna Snug the blue sky's, birds flying over the lake, the trees, and the peace and quiet was fantastic 😊 || I love the saunas here they are clean spacious and have the best views of the countryside especially great at sunset. The lake is clear, beautiful and fresh for a dip to cool off its a great way to unwind and clear your head. I highly recommend the Sauna Snug I go regularly now and look forward to it every time. || I’ve loved the place. I tried different ones during this past months, and I just felt this one is amazing😍 || Really lovely experience at this sauna. It's a beautiful setting and dipping in the lake is a real treat.

To our horror we realised that there is a large cavity between the floor and wall (see pictures below) - a huge health & safety risk. The cavity was around 5cm wide in parts so we flashed a light and were unable to see the earbud. I spoke to Amy at the reception who said that she would look with a rubbish picker and offered nothing else. She also explained that this happened already with a customer who dropped their keys but “the guys” were able to get them. I stated my concern for the health & safety cavity in the floor directly under the ladies changing benches to which she said “we’re not open that long and we’ve already fixed the roof and that it’s up to the guy who owns the building not the enterprise renting?” I replied that I didn’t think it was good enough, she  offered no compensation or apology.  A half an hour later she found us in the sauna while she was adding blocks to the fire, and said she tried but couldn’t see anything and “taking the floor boards up would be tricky” I asked if that was an option she said no. . So I asked for a pair of gloves to search myself her response was her arms/ hands were too lanky but someone like my with smaller hands would be better for the job”, her solution was that we could stay in the sauna a bit longer? Allowing a customer to even go near the cavity filled with sharp nails, dirty socks is a health violation in itself. We entered the changing room about 10 mins later, & we saw Amy had left the picker there for us to use to no avail.  I had to then with my friends assistance to lay on the floor searching with a plastic bag over my hand, I wasn’t able to search for long due to the rusty nails sticking outwards. We decided is wasn’t worth searching for given the dirt. My friend had hung her coat and bottoms on opposite coat hangers, which were soaked right through - so the roof repair clearly wasn’t up to par. As we left, I asked Amy to process a refund for today, her face squirmed in disbelief. I said it’s a health & safety risk, you’ve not offered up any compensation, and showed her the coat that was completely soaked through on the hook (see in picture). Her response was sharp, “that’s what the lockers are there for when it’s raining” I said you don’t have a sign up stating that you have a leaky roof under both the areas where my friend hung her clothes? Same with the floor there should be a sign to be careful for the gap. She reminded us that they aren’t open that long, to which I said the hot box group have been running for a long time & we’ve been loyal customers and secondly, this issue has happened in the past so why haven’t they sorted the cavity from a health and safety point of view. I asked for her name & asked her to confirm that she didn’t think my refund request was fair due to the shock on her face. She said she’d be happy for me to add all of my concerns into a Google review instead. || Everything was perfect, staff is delightful and the place is stunning! I am leaving 4 stars only because there is no toilet available but: will definitely be back :D lovely. || 43rd Finnish sauna review: location is simply stunning. 2 wood fired sauna on the Irish coast. Each sauna was around 98c. 2 level of benches. Harvia stoves. The stove is well sized for the sauna, allowing 8 or so people per sauna. The löyly is soft, but based on the small sauna size doesn’t mess around either. The ladle was unique; allowing a good scoop of water but allowed  gradual stream into the rocks, helping with the soft feeling. The team kept the stove well fed throughout the session. Very short walk to the ocean. Great location, great experience. || The Hot Box Sauna in Killiney is an absolute must when visiting the area. It’s a truly unique and refreshing experience. The setting is spectacular, with panoramic views of the coastline that make it feel extra special. The sauna itself is beautifully maintained, and the option to cool off with a sea swim or outdoor shower is invigorating. A special shout out to Amy and Otis, whose warm hospitality make the experience even more enjoyable. They are attentive, welcoming, and clearly passionate about ensuring everyone has a memorable visit. Highly recommended! || We visited for the first time this week. It was so great. From the moment we arrived Otis was a great host, made us feel very welcome. The location is perfect, the ocean crashing outside the large sauna window helps to draw you into a state of relaxation and reflection. We will definitely be back. Thanks Otis!"

I telephoned this morning to find out when the remodelling would finish. Phone rang out 23 times (set to redial) without being answered. Management and staff show no regard for regular customers. Dublin needs a professionally run sauna, not this shambles. || I'm considering visiting this weekend but very concerned about the reviews I have read. It's not very clear if your establishment has all the facilities in place, and in good working order. Equally, are men of colour welcome here and not treated with prejudice? As a global blogger, I'm interested to see if this established brand lives up to its reputation || Review – The Boilerhouse Dublin
I would like to raise a concern regarding the conduct of a staff member named Filip (identifiable by tattoos).
During my visit, his behaviour towards customers was unprofessional, impolite, and lacked basic respect. While on duty, he appeared distracted and more focused on socialising for personal enjoyment rather than carrying out his assigned responsibilities. This behaviour created an unprofessional atmosphere and negatively affected the overall customer experience.
Customer-facing staff should maintain a high standard of professionalism at all times. Unfortunately, this standard was not met on this occasion."

Nice staff
Nice view
Easy access from city for a short day trip.

Not so good:
Heat is definitely not as hot as others i have used. However this may be part of it's unique style as a caravan vs purpose built sauna barrel etc.
Little on the expensive side for what it is.

So for newbies to sauna I would recommend but anyone looking for intense heat, try elsewhere. Nice visit for tourist to pass a few hours from city centre. || Wonderful little sauna i found the tempeture really good  even bwttee was the lovely lad who was full of knowledge and very welcoming...it seems people would rather complain about bottled water  than there experience     it aint state of the art but perfectl location right on the sea..absolute  pleasure   i suppose u cant please the public. Dnt let one or two bad remarks  put u off having a nice experience. try it for yoursel..the  competiors envy is real.. || Similar thoughts to another reviewer.
This feels like an absolute cash-grab. 20€ for an hour is well too expensive for what you get.

Major problems are:
1. The sauna itself:
- It is not well insulated.
- The door doesn't shut properly so there is a
cold draft coming in constantly.
- Single glazed window saps the heat out of the
sauna.
- Lack of cleanliness from the floor and the
boards you sit on.
- No thermometer.
- No double door/porch area so when someone
leaves the sauna all the heat is sucked out.
- Most saunas you can last max 15
minutes but here I spent the whole 1 hour
session in the sauna without needing a break.
It felt like a warm room with cold drafts rather
than a sauna.
2. Amenities:
- no showers,
- no toilets or sinks
- no lockers
- no changing rooms
- no taps to refill water
- no plunge pool. There is the sea which is
great but for 20 euro there should at least be
an in-house shower

Positives: small coffee shop in there and staff are nice.

Would not return. || This review is about sustainability only! ☺️

I was disappointed to see the sale of plastic bottled water on the premises. Especially a mere stone’s throw from the beach.

By 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Over 95% of the plastic that we create, use, and even intentionally recycle, does not actually get recycled. Instead, it ends up in landfills, incinerators, and in our waters. It then breaks down into micro plastics, which are having a profoundly negative effect on human health, let alone other species.

The ancient global (and local) tradition of sauna and sweat lodge has no place for plastics. In fact, it feels antithetical to the practice at large.

I wonder if instead you could at least sell aluminum, canned water, as aluminum can be infinitely recycled. But selling plastics to those who have come to enjoy a very place that is being degraded by plastics, feels misguided.

Thank you for considering how to run this sauna more sustainably. I had a wonderful time here, and the service was friendly. But surely there is a way to better align sauna philosophy and wisdom with sustainability efforts. Our earth can’t wait. || 5 stars to this amazing located Sauna. Friendly and helpful staff and literally just in front of Sandycove Beach and just a minute's walk from Forty Foot. Definitely, the installation can be renewed with time and move stuff around so the Sauna window could actually point out to the beach instead of the coffee shop. (Just a suggestion) The place has so much potential and I wish them the best of luck with its service."

Reply to owner response: The review was an honest reflection of our experience. The intention was to make other customers aware, as we would have appreciated this information before our visit.

The showers and toilet in the adjacent gym being open for use for sauna users - were absolutely not mentioned to us at sign‑in. We were told that one of the three cold plunges had been emptied that day; the other two were, unfortunately, not pleasant to use.

I also didn’t mention that two lads were using the facilities in their boxers. That may not bother some people, but it wasn’t pleasant for us.

As noted in my review, the saunas and hot tubs themselves are good. I appreciate you’re running a business and not all customers will care about the points I raised—but some will, which is why I felt the review was worth posting. It wasn’t intended to cause damage, just to inform.

Definitely the best in the business! I picked the most perfect of winters days with Pete & Karl delivering the most perfect of experiences. Love your work lads. I’ll be back 🔜 || Amazing experience. So therapeutic! Loved the barrel sauna and the yurt! Highly recommend trying out both & going for a dip in the lake / ice buckets afterwards. The lads are really sound and made the experience very comfortable and enjoyable! Will definitely be coming back soon || Fantastic experience. After half a day of riding bikes at the GAP we popped into the barrel sauna to recover and relax. The setup is brilliant, views from the location are splendid and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Cold plunge in the lake is a must! We will be back. || I booked TIGH’N ALLUIS Irish Sweat House for my birthday and I can honestly say it was one of the most incredible experiences I have ever had in Ireland.

Nestled in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains the setting alone is breathtaking. The views are insane the kind that make you stop breathe and feel unbelievably lucky to be exactly where you are. It felt remote peaceful and deeply restorative yet still so accessible.

The service was genuinely on par with a five star resort. Every detail was thoughtfully considered every interaction warm professional and welcoming without ever feeling forced. You are made to feel completely looked after from the moment you arrive in a way that feels personal rather than transactional.

And the cleanliness wow. Immaculate does not even begin to cover it. Every space was spotless serene and clearly cared for with pride. If I could shout one thing from the top of the mountains surrounding this place it would be how impeccably clean and beautifully maintained it is.

TIGH’N ALLUIS is not just a sweat house it is an experience. A perfect blend of nature luxury calm and care. Booking this for my birthday was the best decision I could have made and I will be recommending it to absolutely everyone. A true hidden gem in the Dublin Mountains 🌿✨ || The sauna at Tigh an Alluis is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The wood fired barrel sauna is always spotlessly clean and you can choose a quick dip in a barrel ice bath or in the lake the sauna overlooks - both as refreshing as you can imagine! The owners Karl and Pete are a wealth of knowledge and are so helpful from start to finish. It won't be long before I'm back again,  it's my favourite spot in Dublin."

The space itself is gorgeous and it was a very calm, relaxed atmosphere. Seafra made the experience so enjoyable with his upbeat, positive and friendly demeanor. He regularly topped up the sauna with different scents and made it such an immersive experience. Going between the ice baths and the sauna was incredible. I had a wonderful time and will definitely be back again very soon! || Very nice sauna facility, relaxed atmosphere, not overcrowded. Super clean and spacious. Tea on arrival is an extra touch to add to experience and the essential oil change every 15 minutes was amazing. The lady working there was absolutely lovely and nice to deal with. Will definitely return and recommend to friends. || Had a lovely experience last week doing the 1 hour sauna and ice bath session at Align Wellness. From the moment we arrived, Ayeesha was very friendly providing us with hot tea & information about the sauna and ice baths. The venue is very clean and calming and I will definitely go back when travelling back to Dublin again for a visit. || This sauna delivers a near-perfect, impeccably clean, and well-kept experience that’s easily 5-star worthy in facilities and service. Will definitely come back. Hot tea greets you on arrival for a warm welcome, and the oil infusions in the sauna create a luxurious, aromatic highlight. The attendant stands out as amazing.

Dropping to 4 stars because there’s no clear signage or reservation notes enforcing silence or minimal voices - crucial for true relaxation, disconnection and recharging in a sauna. It’s often ruined by pairs of gals besties gossiping loudly like it’s Sunday brunch, filling the space with chatter for the entire hour and it had me leaving with a headache. Signs stating “keep silence” or low volume would help with guest behaviour without blaming the business. || Align is like nowhere I've been before. The whole experience of the guided sauna session with Katie was absolutely magical. Every little detail is thought of, from the cup of tea to the lighting in the sauna, the essential oils, the ice. The facilities are just incredible. I will definitely be back!"

Maria gave me a facial and arm/neck and shoulder massage that was simply the best I’ve ever experienced. I cannot recommend it enough and my skin simply glowed for days after!! It’s a MUST!!! || I was kindly invited to the buff day spa for a customised facial. The staff were friendly, helpful and professional. Maria really took the time to listen to my skin concerns. She also gave me advice after my facial for my at home skincare. Since then my skin has improved drastically. I suffer with acne especially around my chin area. I enjoyed relaxing in the tranquility room after my facial. || I and my girlfriend had the pleasure of visiting this wonderful spa and was warmly welcomed from the moment we arrived. The staff were genuinely friendly, and we were shown to a private suite, which immediately set the tone for a relaxing experience.

The Swedish oil massage was exceptional—deeply relaxing and expertly done. We also made full use of the sauna and the Tranquility Room, which was especially calming with its gentle, ASMR-like waterfalls. A glass of prosecco, along with soothing tea, added a thoughtful touch.

The entire experience felt unhurried and well worth it. I would highly recommend this spa and will absolutely be returning. || I had the Pause Ritual at Buff Day Spa and it genuinely exceeded my expectations. I loved every minute and left the spa glowing — the results were visible straight away. Maria, the senior therapist, has truly magical hands and made the whole experience so relaxing and personalised.

She recommended the Dermalogica NeuroTouch Symmetry Serum afterwards, and even though it’s on the pricier side, it’s packed with advanced ingredients and you only need a tiny amount. It really helped maintain the lifted, smoother, more balanced look in the days after my treatment.

I’ll definitely be returning and purchasing the serum. Highly recommend! || A calm oasis amidst the craziness of Dublin, perfect for treating yourself!

If you like medium to firm massage pressure, I can wholeheartedly recommend Brooke and Nico - they are exceptional. Brooke also does really nice facials and so does Florentina! But honestly, all their staff is good, so you'll have a good experience no matter what!"

The whole experience was diabolical to say the least. We could list off at least 20-30 points of issues (no exaggeration) the experience was that bad we couldn’t leave with anything being unsaid.
We arrived to a reception that was unwelcoming (staff standing behind a desk talking amongst themselves) and two maintenance men on a ladder fixing the ceiling.
We arrived in the relaxation room where we chatted before our treatments. Three young male therapists walked in to collect us(we were never asked upon booking nor asked upon check in if we were ok with a male therapist) it is a standard that this is asked. They even confirmed this later that evening during our complaint.
The staff had only arrived in Dublin one month ago. This was apparent as there was clearly no training carried out and if there was there was no supervision of a senior staff member to confirm that they were competent to carry out the treatments. The treatments we had were not as described in the brochure. The massages were mediocre and the staff were clearly not trained in facials, it was a series of applying creams then removing with dry cotton pads, at one point it felt that the fluff was coming off the pads and left on face, my therapist kept alternating between face/shoulders it was so inconsistent. Any facial I had before left the shoulder massage until the end of the treatment, I am almost certain my therapist was on his phone at the beginning and mid treatment probably to check the steps of what he was doing. Our mascara was still on after the facial had ended and face felt sticky and unwashed. The product was not applied to our décolletage.
My mother had to stop the therapist half way because it was obvious that he was not trained. Everything about the facial was wrong, having had many facials across many spas in many countries you are aware of the common steps regardless of what brand or products are used and she just knew this was not right. She called for a manager, a female therapist came to discuss what was wrong. No solution was offered.During this time my sister was having her massage treatment which she left feeling extremely uncomfortable due to the consistent conversation/questioning by her therapist. Questions such as ‘what music do you like’, ‘have you been to Japan’, ‘where he was brought up and holidayed with his parents’ completely unrelated to the treatment. Upon leaving the treatment she was met by the senior therapist on duty in the treatment corridor who informed her she would be charged 50% cancellation fee as she was not having a facial. This was something we informed the therapist at the beginning and were told that was no problem.  This was completely in appropriate timing and extremely pressurising.
Upon returning to the relaxation room we learnt of each others experience and the female therapist that had been dealing with my mother came to discuss the matter with us, we then explained again what happened. After 20minutes the male senior therapist came to the relaxation room to listen to our complaint. We should not have had to repeat ourselves a second time (a third time for my mother)
All we were told was that they will have to speak to a manager but that they may not be able to get in contact with one.
Upon leaving the spa one hour after the original complaint the therapist on the reception took out her mobile and said ‘oh your leaving, I just have to call someone’. At this point we were leaving and not waiting for a solution, I had informed the therapist that I would accept a call that evening if there was someone on duty if not then I would expect a call the following morning. I received an email at 8pm that evening from the receptionist to apologise again and that the spa director Margaret McCallum would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the matter on Wednesday.  I am still awaiting a response and it’s Friday!! || I was given a gift card of a Luxury Spa massage and facial treatment. It was wonderful!
Do go 15mins. before your appointment time to allow for filling in the forms.
The Spa entrance is 3 doors down from the main entrance to the Hotel, on the right hand side.
In the reception lounge I was offered a tea of my choice while I filled in my details.
You can choose the type of massage, Thai or hot stone, and  whether you want it done lightly, medium or firm etc.
Also, depending on your skin type you can tailor your facial to your particular needs.
You can choose to use the swimming pool and sauna area before or after your massage if you wish.
I was then introduced to my masseuse, a friendly, professional Thai lady who spent 90 mins. on my massage and facial.
The heated massage table, the use of aroma therapy oils and the relaxing music enhanced the whole experience.
After a shower, sauna and a dip in the pool I snuggled up in my cosy dressing gown and slippers and relaxed in the private lounge room overlooking St. Stephens green and read from a choice of glossy magazines while I drank a cranberry juice and later a sweet berry tea. Each person has their own couch with a wrap around silk headboard for added luxury and privacy.
I can totally recommend this luxury spa experience. See my photos of the areas I have described. Enjoy! || My son treated me to a spa day which cost 335 euro in total.
Changing into my robe I was given a pair of flip flops. One a size 5 approx and one poss a size 8. The full body massage was reasonable but not memorable. The facial was a series of creams applied. Creams removed. Creams applied… Perhaps 4/5 times. I’m not sure she knew what she was doing. Marianna the tattooed masseuse then moved on to my head massage. Very poor show. She proceeded to endlessly tangle my hair and no real massage technique.
She then showed me to the relaxation room with a few other ladies.
It was only when I went to the toilet that I saw what state I was in, in the mirror. I had large panda eyes where my eyemakeup had not been removed properly and my hair was an outageous bouffant of a birds nest. I felt humiliated and embarassed. This spa is at best a 2 star set up. The Shellbourne would be best to close it down rather than damage the hotels reputation further by associating with it. || I may have booked the wrong treatment, but I wanted to share my understanding of what a pedicure typically includes. For me, a pedicure is not just about having polished nails, but about achieving healthy, well-groomed feet — free of corns, excess cuticles, and other issues.

In my case, the treatment mainly included nail polishing and some moisturizing. One of the nails ended up crooked, which I didn’t notice during the procedure as I trusted the specialist to shape the nails correctly without my oversight.

I believe a pedicure should go beyond cosmetic care and include proper attention to foot health. It would have been helpful to know the scope of the treatment in advance to ensure expectations were aligned. || I had the pleasure of having a facial with my best friend on Tuesday.

The staff in the shelbourne are so professional 👏 they made sure our visit was very luxurious. We had the use of all the spa facilities which we thoroughly enjoyed.

Irmak carried out the most beautiful relaxing uplifting facial🥰using amazing products. I felt as if I was walking on air for the day.

The wonderful staff then proceeded to introduce us to a beautiful quiet room to relax  where they served us beautiful fruit and champagne.
I would highly recommend a visit.
A huge thank you to all the staff ."

After extensive research online and going into showrooms around Dublin (Ireland), I decided to order from Nebula Spa as the price was by far the best but it didnt not include assemply/installation which local companies could. The order was delayed and took a bit longer to arrive as I ordered when Trump announced his tarriffs and the logistics market when into meltdown. It only resulted in a two week delay which I was fine with but Nebula Spa sent me some gifts in the meantime which was a very nice touch.

I ordered the Nordic Bliss 2 (2 person) Traditional Electric Sauna and it came in flat back packaging which were heavy to move upon delivery. It took me around half a day to assemble the sauna myself and it wouldnt be feasible to assemble by someone without some strength as the parts are big and heavy. The instructions were not very clear so it took a bit longer but I managed to figure it out as there were no screws or drilling involved, just assembly of the various large sauna component parts.

Once fully assembled, I noticed the heater needs an electrician to install. This was were I came into difficulty as it was hard to find an electrician to take on the job or one that knew how to hardwire a sauna heater. The heater has to be connected directly into fuse box so you cannot do it yourself, unless you're an electrician. Eventually I got an electrician in and he found the instructions difficult to read and follow so it was a more difficult job than anticipated.

The installation was the hard part and I would probably have considered ordering an infrared sauna as this is plugged into socket so easy installation. The electrician cost was not cheap and it was a full days work given the sauna was not set up in the house so it added onto the price of the sauna itself.

Regardless, the sauna is working perfectly now and I'm very happy with the product, just be warned that the Traditional/Electric sauna needs work and a strong person to assemble and also an electrician to hook up the sauna heater which incurs an additional cost. || It would be nice if they had a phone service but their email service is really good. Ordered the Crystal Sauna and waited just over a week and received an additional gift. It’s nice the way delivery is free || Absolutely Brilliant customer service, I’ve been looking to purchase a jacuzzi for the summer and I couldn’t have found a better place to do it. The employee gave me the best choices to pick from to satisfy my needs. He was also very generous with the deal that he has given me and the delivery service was effortless. Will definitely be recommending to my friends. Perfect in time for the warmer season! || At first I was sceptical the way it's an online store and I thought they are realitvely new on the market. I was worried about the delivery and quality of the bathtub and sauna I ordered not being best quality as advertised. However I was very nicely surprised as the sauna's and the bathtub's build quality was exceptionally good and I received both in less than two weeks after ordering, also I received a little surprise gift from the company. So overall I am very happy with my experience with Nebulaspa and most likely will buy a hot tub soon. || I recently had the pleasure of shopping at Nebula Spa and I couldn't be more satisfied with the experience. The website is user-friendly, offering a wide range of high-quality bathtubs and jacuzzis to suit every need and budget. Customer service was exceptional, providing prompt and knowledgeable responses to my queries."

Aquasun a few months ago. I dealt with Maria in the showrooms and she was a pleasure to deal with. Post install I had a couple of minor issues. Once I informed Aquasun of these , they were,  on both occasions resolved promptly and with the highest level of customer care. The post sale customer care that Aquasun provide is exceptional and the professionalism of their staff is a credit to them all. In a time where great customer service is not always a given Aquasun are certainly a fantastic example on how it should be done. Well done Aquasun! || First encountered Aquasun at a show in the RDS years ago.  I was impressed with their professional knowledge and non pushy sales approach.  I said if I was going to buy a tub I'd call in.  So this year we did exactly that.  Ronan, our sales guy, spent plenty of time with us.  He showed us everything they had in stock and explained all the pros and cons of each tub.  Finally we settled on a Hotspring Flair.  In these strange times delivery, like everything else was uncertain, but Ronan said end of July was realistic.  The tub arrived first week in August, so that's pretty much spot on.  The installers came and they had a difficult task getting the tub to its final place in the garden, but they did it efficiently and quickly with absolutely no damage to the decking, not even a tiny scratch.  One of the guys stayed behind and commissioned it and a day later we were using the tub.  I've since been back into the store for some top up chems and Debbie spent more time with ironing out a few small water quality questioned I had.  I'd highly recommend Aquasun if you're in the market for a tub or pool. || We were looking for an outdoor sauna suitable for our back garden. Nathan was great and showed us loads of different ones but we fell in love with the barrel sauna and chose to go with the bigger 3.5m barrel sauna. It only took about 10 weeks to arrive...from Lithuania 🇱🇹..and delivery and installation was superb. The guys were brilliant and didn't mind us filming everything. It was so cool to see it being put together.  Our electrician came a few days later and sorted that out for us and we were up and running that evening.  Its so easy to operate and so relaxing. The bigger size was worth it as it meant we had the changing room 1st so on wet or cold nights we could pop from that to the sauna room and back without coming outside. A beer..a glass of wine...and some relaxing music...and a good hot sweat...heaven. Thanks a million to Nathan and Debbie and all the gang. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like their own private garden spa. 🥰 || Great people to deal with. They do what they say and do it when they say they'll do it. Their after sales is exceptional... I sent an email with a problem with one of the clasps on my hot tub cover - they replied by return. I sent a follow up email, and they responded almost immediately. At 8.15 the following morning, a solution to the problem was delivered to my front door! Now that's service. I have no hesitation in recommending them.
PS. The hot tub is great too!

Westport || We recently bought a flair hot tub and a 4 man infrared sauna from Aquasun.

I had a very pleasant experience at Anantara Spa in Dublin, visiting with my daughter.

The staff were warm, professional and attentive. We were welcomed right on time at 2:15 pm — always appreciated when you value good organisation.The spa facilities are beautiful: jacuzzi, saunas, calm atmosphere and a truly relaxing massage. The relaxation room afterwards was the perfect finishing touch. Also, special mention to the gentleman at reception for his excellent service.

Just one small note from a very relaxed (but attentive) guest 😊
I had booked a one-hour massage, but because we were kindly invited to use the bathroom and allowed to take a few videos before starting, the massage itself lasted around 40 minutes, finishing exactly at 3:15 pm. Had I known, I would have saved those “pre-spa rituals” for later — timing matters when you want to enjoy every minute.

Overall, a beautiful spa, skilled professionals and a very enjoyable experience.
Highly recommended — just keep the timing in mind to make the most of it ✨ || I love coming here, especially due to Efi, the massage therapist. She is truly amazing! I keep coming back cause her massage is both relaxing and very effective, she works my muscles really well and I always leave feeling completely refreshed and moving better due to less tension in my muscles. She is also great with adjusting to my individual needs especially cause I have had some past injuries, she is very attentive and she always knows what to do. If you want to truly relax, book a session with her! The facilities are also great and really help before and after a session to fully unwind and relax || Booked this hotel for the misfits event, it is expensive but worth every penny!

Our room was huge, modern but classy. The mattress, Pillows, Sheets were incredible one of the best nights sleep I’ve had in ages.

We visited the spa on multiple occasions, sauna was great, steam room was great, pool is huge! Hot tub could do with some improvements as the jets were quite weak especially around the back area but other than that honestly 9/10. If you’re after a dark moody spa where you can really just relax this is the spa for you!

Treatment! We decided to book in for a couples massage the 30/30, 30mins Back.. 30 mins Facial, and it was incredible, genuinely one of the best massages I’ve ever had! And I wasn’t pressured into buying products after, they took us to a relaxation room with electric beds that are to die for! Oh and I forgot to mention the massage bed was heated!

Everything included 10/10 recommend this spa if you want that luxury get away feeling! || Update:
After complaining to the spa, the manager was prompt and arranged an alternate massage with their most skilled therapist. Thank you :)
———————————————————————-I'm incredibly disappointed with the massage I received. For 200 EUR, I expected a far more professional and skilled experience. The therapist seemed utterly inexperienced, lacking any knowledge of pressure points or massage techniques. The entire session felt like my body was simply being rubbed with oil. There was no rhythm, no flow, and the pressure was uneven on both sides of my body.

The back massage was almost non-existent, and the hot stones were literally jammed into my neck. The head massage was the worst part - it felt more like scratching than an actual massage. My scalp started burning after 20 minutes, forcing me to ask her to stop. Despite my attempts to provide feedback, the therapist seemed unable to adjust her technique.

I have never had to stop a massage halfway through before, but this experience was so subpar that I had no choice. I strongly advise against booking a massage with this therapist. || Perfect, the complex is very beautiful and pleasant, just like the staff. Only a few minor issues, such as a jacuzzi button that no longer works, for example."

Bed and pillows were so nice, too. The breakfast is a generous buffet with full Irish plus cold options. The spa downstairs in the gym is a nice addition, our plans fell through so I got a massage instead. || ​The Camden Court Hotel is, quite simply, a five-star experience wrapped up in Dublin's most well active neighborhood. From the moment I stepped into the beautifully appointed lobby, I knew I was in for a treat. This isn't just a place to sleep; it's a genuine highlight of any trip to the capital.
​
The Unbeatable Location & Convenience
​Nestled perfectly on Camden Street, the location is prime. You are literally steps away from Dublin's best pubs, dining, and nightlife, yet the hotel itself provides a quiet, restful sanctuary. Grafton Street, iveagh Gardens and St. Stephen's Green are just a short, pleasant walk away. For those traveling for business or attending an event, the connectivity is flawless.
​
Luxurious Comfort & Spotless Rooms
​My room was an absolute haven. It was immaculately clean, spacious, and designed with a superb eye for comfort and modern aesthetics. The bed was cloud-like, guaranteeing one of the best nights' sleep I've had away from home. Every detail—from the quality linens to the excellent in-room amenities—showed a dedication to guest satisfaction.
​
Exceptional Facilities
​The on-site leisure center is a massive bonus. Having access to a full-sized swimming pool, gym, and spa facilities is a wonderful luxury, especially after a long day of exploring or working. It truly elevates the Camden Court from a hotel to a comprehensive wellness escape.
​
Dining That Impresses
​Breakfast was a particular delight! The selection was vast, fresh, and high-quality, catering to every taste. The staff in the restaurant were attentive and friendly, made any adjustments to time i had requested with open arms and welcoming smile of genuine human kindness and ensuring a great start to the day. If you choose to dine here, im sorry to say but expect delicious food and efficient service.
​but i have to say that The Heart of the Hotel: The Staff
​What truly sets the Camden Court Hotel apart is its incredible team. The staff members are consistently warm, professional, and genuinely eager to help. Check-in and check-out were seamless, and any request was handled immediately and with a smile. Their friendly disposition makes you feel valued, not just as a guest, but as a welcomed visitor.
​In conclusion, the Camden Court Hotel delivers on every front. If you are looking for phenomenal value, luxury, and an atmosphere that feels both central and peaceful, look no further. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and eagerly anticipate my next stay!
They even have reusable hand towels in the bathrooms of exceptional cleanliness!

Talk about an economic friendly modern stylish friendly welcoming hotel that has it all!! No thats just the Camden Court Hotel || Loved staying here. Good location,and next to the second oldest pub in Dublin!
About 15 min walk to temple bar area.
Spa was great, good size pool,sauna and steam.
Had treatments with clover Thai massage and it was BRILLIANT!! Highly recommend getting the massage and facial duo. Diana and her colleague were great.
The gym was good size& good equipment .
The breakfast was great also. Emma the bar manager was really helpful and fun!
Check out time was mid day. So was lovely to use all the pool etc,before we left!
Definitely recommend to stay here! || I was stayed over at Camden court for business and my stay was great. I must say, the food was incredible. Also, it was well priced for Dublin. The only issue was the hot water in the room. It takes for ever to get lukewarm. The gym, pool and sauna was very clean and really made the stay that much better. No better way to start your day with the gym, sauna and swim. || Stayed at Camden Court for three nights recently and found all aspects of the hotel excellent. We were a party of four senior ladies and staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. Food was delicious and all areas of the hotel were beautifully presented. Highly recommend this hotel"

The facilities are top-quality, always clean, and well maintained, with everything you need for a great workout. The atmosphere is really motivating, and the staff are friendly, professional, and always happy to help.

Whether you’re a beginner or more experienced, West Wood has something for everyone. I genuinely enjoy training here and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great gym with a positive environment.

Also a big shoutout to Jack, he’s very sweet, kind and always helping us! || I've heard stories about dreadful customer service in West Wood Club but still wanted to give it a go and have my own experience. Unfortunately, stories were not rumours. Went there for one day trial with my friend who is a member, spent 2 hours waiting in reception before I could even go in. A month later sent an email asking about membership and got no responce. Applied to a 4 day trial on website, hoping to get a full trial this time or get someone to contact me about membership. Received a very cheerful email from Gavin Willis offering me 4 day trial and saying that I will receive a call same day to arrange time and date. This didn't happen, instead I received a follow-up email from Gavin, with more great offers, including bringing a friend with me to my free trial and a discount on joining fee. All I had to do is to email back with date and time. I did that, also asking few questions, didn't get any responce, but got a message to my phone, from Gavin again, saying if I'm still interested in free trial to call the number provided.  Called the number several times, nobody picked up, sent another email and got response two days later from different person Eanna McCarthy asking to confirm date and time to book me in for a free trial. Emailed back with a date and time but received responce, saying that I have already used my trial and can't have another one but they are happy to discuss membership options with me 🤯. So a week of wasting my time, sending me all those great offers and eventually saying that because I used facilities one day, I actually can't avail of everything they offered me earlier. I would understand and accept such responce on the first email, but its unacceptable after I received 4 emails and a text message saying I'm welcome to use a 4 day trial. At this point, I've completely lost my motivation spending my money in this gym. They might have great facilities but the customer service is something they need to focus on, specially when asking 600 as a joining fee. || They recently set up a Les Mills ceremony class next to the tennis courts. The class generates extremely loud noise, which is further amplified by the building’s structure. The instructor’s voice echoes throughout the entire venue, even though most paying members are not participating in the class at the same time. These inconveniences were not properly communicated before the class was introduced, and members are now left to endure the disruption without choice.

I raised a complaint, but nothing was improved. To make matters worse, one of the staff members, Alex, even lectured me face-to-face, saying “you have to appreciate…” while I was simply trying to raise a legitimate concern. Another staff member went as far as questioning whether I had a full membership. The way this was asked made me feel like I was not the “right type, white and posh enough” customer to belong there.

It is clear that the staff training is not focused on understanding member concerns or making improvements, but rather on dismissing and silencing paying customers whose right to enjoy the facilities has been compromised.

Edit:
1.Katie has not responded my email yet.
2.I measured the db level with my phone, and it was amazingly over 95! Shout out to the authorities! It's better to check if WW has provided PPE to its employees. || The best gym in Dublin. The equipment is to a very high standard. The spa is just incredible to have access to. And all of the staff are brilliant. In particular I would like to highlight how handsome the reception and sales team are. Conor & Alex do a great job as the front of house and you couldn’t ask for more. Westwood’s finest 😮‍💨🙌🤠

I would also like to give a shout out to another unsung hero at Westwood Clontarf – front desk legend, Magic Mike. He’s always so polite, incredibly knowledgeable, and really attentive to customers on the desk. He genuinely takes the time to make sure members are looked after, and is always keen to help whenever needed.

Recently, when I forgot my towel, Mike went above and beyond by sorting me out with a complimentary one as a one-off – that’s the kind of 5-star service you expect from a 5-star health club, and it really makes a difference to loyal members.

On top of that, Mike has the best smile on the reception team (and yes, it was very difficult to choose a winner from such a highly competitive team!).

Thanks again Mike – you make every visit that bit better. || The gym looks modern and the equipment is good, but it is completely overcrowded. They sign up far more members than they can actually handle. There is always a queue for machines and it feels like you are waiting more than you are working out. The two month notice period when you leave is ridiculous. What is this, a divorce settlement?

Another issue is the amount of teens wandering around the adult gym floor. They have their own teen gym but they prefer the main area which is already too packed. I have seen them roughhousing and messing around with little to no supervision. It is unsafe and distracting.

The layout of the gym is also poorly designed. There is a boxing area where more equipment could be, a stretching area that takes up too much space, and a teen gym that adults cannot use even though the adult area is the one overflowing.

Looks nice on the surface, but the daily experience is crowded, noisy and frustrating. Changing rooms are crowded as well with little to no space in the lockers."

The Boat Yard Sauna is hands down one of my favourite places. I go at least once a week and honestly, I’d go more if I could. The moment you step in, everything slows down. Sitting in the heat, looking out at the sea - it’s pure magic. That view alone is worth it.

The atmosphere is always calm and welcoming. The team are great, friendly, easygoing, and they clearly care about keeping the place clean and running well. It’s spotless every time.

What I really love is the people you meet. There’s something about sitting in a sauna, dripping sweat, that strips away pretense. Everyone’s just there to relax, unwind, and reset. It’s peaceful, grounding, and oddly social in the best way.

If you’re thinking about it - just go. You won’t regret it. || Such a lovely experience at the Boat Yard this evening. The facilities are top notch and the place is spotless.

There seemed to have been too many people in our time slot at least 40 people- so you had to wait for friend groups to leave saunas/pools.
Also the womens changing room should be cleaned after each group as there was so much hair on the floor and the lockers weren’t unlocked for the next person to use so we had to keep our belongings in an unlocked locker. || Really nice sauna experience especially at night with great choice of saunas and plunge pools of different temperatures.

Sauna was 100 degrees plus. Fabulous views over Roberts cove. The sea was clear and the beach clean. One of the best sauna experiences of my life. || 10/10 the best sauna experience I’ve had. The sauna was at a perfect temperature between 95-100 degrees. Robert’s Cove is a sand beach so no need to worry about walking on stones! Sara is an amazing host and even provides a skin scrub for your final dip! || Incredible sauna. Just had the loveliest swim/ sauna session. Sara is a 10/10 host. Head and body feeling great now. She also has a sugar scrub, skin feeling very soft || Swede Sauna is an amazing amenity located in Roberts Cove!
The facilities are perfect for anyone looking to experience hot and cold therapy!
I think it is an ideal way to enjoy swimming in cold open water during the winter months and as soon as we tried the Sauna once we are hooked!

The owner Sara is very friendly. She is really enthusiastic about her business and keeps her Sauna spotlessly clean!
She is always looking into new ways to help make the session a more immersive experience for her customers!
Some of the things Sara does is that she adds essential oils to the water bucket inside the sauna. Then as you pour this water over the hot rocks the steam is infused with the oils.
She also holds birching Sauna sessions, Yoga Sauna sessions and full moon Sauna sessions!

The Sauna:
It is a traditional wood framed Sauna which uses a wood burning stove to produce the heat. The stove is fuelled from the exterior while the body of the stove and chimney is on the inside. There are rocks surrounding the body of the stove and are constantly being heated.
There is a bucket of water beside the stove with a ladle and this can be used to pour water over the rocks to create steam!
There is a hygrometer and a thermometer allowing the customer to monitor conditions within the Sauna. There is also a sand timer in the Sauna rated in 5 minute increments and a maximum of 15 minutes. This ideal to track your session and wearing an electronic watch or metal watch is not ideal in the hot and humid environment of the Sauna!

Benefits for me:
I'm not going to claim all the benefits that some people say that Saunas and cold water swimming can aid to however, I do feel amazing after a session and Sara's Sauna is in the perfect location for me.
I love immersing myself in the cold water for a few minutes and then going for about a 15 minute sweat and then back into the water. Each time that we have went so far we have gone for an hour and we aim to get 4 to 5 dips with each session.
The amount of swims or how long you want to spend in the Sauna is all up to you and I find the sand timer great for this!

Cost:
I think the Sauna is very reasonable at €10 for half an hour or €20 for a full hour. This is for an open session where you and others can come and go as you or they please.
There is the option of booking a private session for €85 for an hour. This is also reasonable in my opinion as if you can split it with 5 or more friends it works out cheaper than an open session!

Tips:
I would look at the tide times so that you can avail of the high tide and don't have to walk to far from the Sauna to get to the water.
Opening times change everyday as I believe Sara follows the high tide so it could be a morning session or an evening session that she is open for.
Bring 2 towels as you will need a fresh towel to dry off afterwards and I recommend to sit on a different one so that you keep it clean/hygenic for other Sauna users!

Overall opinion:
I think that the experienct you get at Swede Sauna is brilliant! Sara is very friendly and the location can't be beaten!
I highly recommend giving it a try, you won't be disappointed! || Have visited Swede Sauna 3 times in the last couple of months with family and friends. Visited at the weekend and  2 out of the 3 times Sara had overbooked the sauna so wasnt as enjoyable experience as other saunas I tried around Cork. Online booking says it holds 8 people but Sara has over booked it to be 12 people. Its too much of a tight squeeze and then youre coordinating with other between re who is in the sauna vs in the sea. The first time it happened Sara said it was an accident that it was overbooked by mistake but then it happened a second time I visited so I think its something that happens regularly. Such a shame as its a gorgeous location, just not very relaxing when youre packed in with too many people. Won't be back unfortunately."

Highly recommend! || I visited the sauna and plunge pool facility yesterday and was blown away by how incredible I felt afterward. The setup is fantastic — spotless, thoughtfully designed, and well-maintained. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. There is access to private changing rooms and the selection of essential oils provided made this whole experience even better. Highly recommend! || Loved my experience at Recoop Sauna and Plunge Pool! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was incredibly relaxing and welcoming.

Gym very dated though and dressing rooms definitely need work. Music is far too loud as most people use their own headphones. Also no one follows the rules. People are always shaving in the men’s dressing rooms which is disgusting. Don’t wear footwear in saunas etc. Always putting those smelly oils in the sauna which I hate. Not wiping down machines. Staff do nothing to stop any of this. Definitely needs an app as well to book classes. Most other gyms have this now. Overall it’s really slipping behind other more modern facilities || Equipment itself was good however wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone looking for just a single months membership. I got a membership here as I travel for work and it was convenient, I signed up then instantly filled out a cancellation form as they recommended however I have been charged for another month and they are ignoring all my emails and instagram messages I’ve sent through (4 and counting) shocking behaviour. || Pretty decent gym & swimming pool, the facilities and management could definitely be improved though.

The main focus seems to be on the gym there, which has 4 huge rooms full of equipment. There's also a separate ladies gym.
As a casual gym-goer, I find that there's a great selection of cardio machines, strength training machines, and loads of free weights. The gym is usually pretty busy during peak times, but you'll always be able to find a spot somewhere.
There's also 2 studios for classes, which can be also be used while there's no classes ongoing.

The pool is grand. It does the job. It's 15m and there's no deep / shallow end, it's all the same depth. There's also a sauna and steam room. There are much better and bigger pools around though, so if you're only wanting to join for the pool, I would consider other options.
The changing rooms, I think, are the biggest downfall. They could definitely be improved. They are open plan, which is fine I guess, but as a very self conscious person, it makes me uncomfortable. There also doesn't seem to be any consideration for gender non-conforming people, as there's only male or female.
There are lockers but you need to bring a lock yourself for them, which is pretty standard. Many of the lockers are broken though, so there's no way to lock them. Generally I've been able to find an available, not broken one though.
The showers leave a lot to be desired. They have frosted glass swinging doors, kind of like a saloon door, but they don't meet fully in the middle so you do feel kind of exposed. I've started hanging my towel spread out completely over it for a bit more privacy, but that doesn't feel very hygienic. There is a basket to put shampoo, etc into, but I haven't seen any hooks to hang things on, which would be nice to have. They have also smelled pretty bad a few times I've been there.
The hairdryers are also, unfortunately very bad. There doesn't seem to be any high power setting so it would take hours to dry your hair completely.

Initially I went down there and asked it I could do a trial run before committing to a membership. Was told they don't do that, and they don't do guest passes so the only options are to sign up immediately (and I believe commit to paying at least 3 months before you can cancel, but I can't quite remember because you don't get any copy of everything you signed) or go elsewhere. They gave me a quick tour of the place though.
So I signed up for a membership because it's within walking distance for me and has basically what I need.
While filling out the forms, I ticked the box to say that I would like to have a gym orientation. According to their website all memberships include ""personalized programs"", but I told them I'd just like to be shown how to use a few of the machines to get started and get a feel for the place and I might look for a specific program later. Was told to come back on 'x' day at 'y' time for it. Grand. Showed up at the specified date and time and they had no idea what I was talking about and didn't have me booked in for anything and had no one there to do an orientation. The lad at reception just gave me (another) tour of the gym, but he was at least very nice about it. || Great place to push your body to the limits. Best hours to train are 6-11am and  8:30-10pm as place is not as crowded. Good selection of machines and free weights. || Absolute disgrace 6 weeks waiting for steam room to be fixed people having to queue for the sauna"

The door man Michael I think it was really made our trip. So welcoming every time and very helpful and informative.

We stayed in a double room. Very spacious. The bathroom is spotless and the cleaners did a stellar job.

We enjoyed our stay so much we extended for a day. The price quoted at reception was quite a bit more expensive than booking on hotels.com or bookings.com. We said this to them and they matched the price instantly. Very happy with all interactions. || This hotel is amazing!! The whole property is huge and so pretty. We got there at night and left the next day, so we weren’t able to use the spa, but it looked amazing. We ate dinner and had breakfast here and everything was really good. Really fresh ingredients and great quality. The room was beautiful and had a bath tub which was so nice because it was so cold, so taking a warm bath was just what I needed. The staff was so kind as well. I recommend this hotel to anyone going to Ireland! || 5* doesn’t give this hotel justice. Top class service with Irish hospitality at its finest.  Was there for 3 days with family of 10. Service was exceptional, standard was beyond amazing and place was spotless. Like with any venue the staff are the backbone and the making of the experience. Everyone person we met was lovely, personable and very professional. Will be back. || Good sized rooms, with a good selection of amenities and comfortable too. Check in and check out was quick as was services in the best and restaurant. The hotel itself is a little shabby in spots and showing its age a little, it's a pure Celtic Tiger creation. It was a little cold too as they haven't turned on the heating and this was late October. Beautiful setting. || We recently stayed here as a family for a few nights and were so happy with our stay. We booked a family room and on booking we were unable to add the no. of children to the booking so we rang and informed them over the phone. We gave the age of our children (one newborn baby) on the call.

When we got to the room there was a beautiful fruit platter and teddy bear in the room congratulating us on our new baby which was lovely and really appreciated. The room was also really spacious and clean with a big bathroom. The beds were very comfortable.

We used the pool which was also clean and could be booked easily and the breakfast in the morning was great with lots of options for everyone.

One of the days we visited Fota Wildlife Park which is just a few minutes drive away and another we spent walking the Fairy Trail on the hotel grounds. The spa facilities are great to unwind with a lovely relaxation room overlooking a peaceful courtyard which you can use after a treatment. There is also a 'cinema room' showing movies for older kids.

Overall I highly recommend a family stay here and we're looking forward to coming back."

Very professional company to deal with , very easy to talk with and very friendly. Always available to speak with during the process from ordering to set up.

We love the new hot tub and use it up to 6 times a week , the jets have a perfect mix of strong and gentle. It has a very strong and durable surround , led lights , speakers and drinks holder.

Best of luck with your business Derek and Carol || The folks working here very nice and very helpful. They are very good at giving advice for the type of hottub you want for your situation and recommending the best lines et cetera. On installation day they came out and spent hours with me showing me how it works, making sure it’s filled, making sure it started and started heating. They also walked me through how to keep it clean which I wouldn’t underestimate for a new begin. All in all, I would highly recommend this company || Got my Hot Tub delivered and installed by Brett. Have to say that Brett was very easy to deal with and talked me through the whole process of what I would need to maintain my Hot Tub. Brett is also at the end of the phone if you have any problems, which is a real bonus and peace of mind. || Purchased the Activity 1 Deep Swimspa last October. Could not be more pleased.

The food at the restaurant was amazing and the service was awesome. We got on with the service manager Kieran (sorry if I spelled his name incorrectly) and he was so easy to talk to and a really nice fellow.
Would 100% recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway. You won't be disappointed. || I recently stayed at The Maryborough Hotel & Spa in Cork, and it was pleasant from start to finish. Nestled in the leafy Douglas area, the hotel perfectly balances comfort with easy access to the city. The old Georgian manor house and gardens all decked out with Christmas 🎄 trees and lights create a stunning backdrop that immediately sets a relaxing tone.

The staff on the whole were consistently warm, attentive, and professional nothing ever felt like too much trouble. From the Spa to the restaurant team, everyone went out of their way to make the stay feel special.

Dining at Bellini’s Restaurant was a highlight. The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor, with excellent options for all dietary preferences.

Breakfast was equally impressive, offering both hearty Irish classics and lighter choices.

The ESPA spa and leisure facilities are world-class. The thermal suite, pool, and treatments provided the perfect escape, and the health club’s narrow indoor pool was a bonus.

Whether you’re visiting for business or a romantic getaway, the hotel caters to every occasion with style and charm.

Overall, The Maryborough is a luxurious yet welcoming, historic hotel.

I left feeling refreshed due to the insanely comfy bed and pillows and already planning my return. I Highly recommended for anyone seeking a memorable stay in Cork. || This is a 2 star hotel with a 4 star reception area. Very disappointed with the Maryborough from the moment we left the reception area. The entire hotel is just run down. The rooms where very gruby with handprints, chips and paint splatter on the walls (see photos). Some of the light switches just didn't work either. The switch for the reading light didn't work on my side but did on my partners. As you can see in the pics, very amateur wiring done on the back of the headboard. Our room was headboard to headboard with the adjacent room which must also have had the same botch job done of sealing the wall as we could hear every word that was said in the other room.

Spa was what really drove me to write this review. Very very unkept, not dirty, just unkept. Thermal room had a plastic bag and 2 cups floating in the water which I had to bin. The whole time we waited for our treatments not one member of staff came in to do a check, or clean. Relaxation beds were broken and gruby.

The service in general was very very poor. Breakfast has a set menu but good luck getting anyone to take your order, and god forbid you ask for something additional because you will be in for a long wait. Staff write down your order and just never come back. Simple things like ""can I get ketchup"" just don't happen until the 4th time asking. Overall the staff were rude and unhelpful, not making room to move in the bar, or restaurant just barging passed because what they are doing is very important. They aren't very welcoming either. If you're unhappy working over new years get another job. || Lovely people lovely place.
Two nights here in the pouring rain as storm Bram approaches.  We have eaten lunch in the bar, it was very good, seafood chowder then fish and chips.
Breakfast, great choices on offer, I had a very rich omelette, coffee great, atmosphere relaxed for a Sunday.
The room, large warm as is the bed.
Great weekend getaway. || This hotel was beautiful!  The location was perfect - just outside of town for easy access, and peaceful.  The breakfast that was included was delicious and the staff were very helpful and kind.  Oh and the beds and pillows were so comfortable!

Whether you’re going for a workout, a swim, or taking part in classes, the Mardyke consistently delivers excellent quality and value. Highly recommended for students, athletes, and anyone looking for a premium fitness environment in Cork! || I signed up for the gym and pool 5 days ago and paid almost €200 upfront for a 3-month membership. Before joining, I clearly asked at reception if members could use the pool even when lessons were running, and I was told yes, as the pool would be divided.

On Saturday (31/01), I brought my 4-year-old daughter to swim. We arrived at 11am and both pools were being used for lessons. I checked again with reception and was told, once more, that we could use the pool.
After getting changed, a pool staff member was extremely rude and told us to leave immediately, saying the children’s pool would be used. I explained calmly that it was my first day and that reception had confirmed we could use half of the pool. He rolled his eyes, spoke rudely, said there would be a break at 11:30 and that we could not stay, then walked away, leaving me speaking alone. We were basically kicked out.
While getting ready to leave, I briefly took my phone out of the locker to put it in my pocket. Another pool staff member, again very rude, almost shouted at me saying I was not authorised to use a phone in the pool area. When I tried to explain, he turned his back on me and walked away, embarrassing me in front of other people.
The overall feeling was that I was there for free and staff were doing me a favour .which is not true. I paid in advance and, as a first-time user, I expected clear guidance and basic respect.
I had to pay extra 15 Euros in other pool in the city,  where I was treated like member, with friendly staffs !!!

If I could get my money back and never return, I would. Unfortunately, I am now locked into a 3-month membership. || Good facilities however very unfriendly staff. I thought it was just my opinion but after speaking to other members it seems to be a lot of people’s opinions. The staff only interact with the elderly members and won’t even smile or say hello to anyone else. You’re far more likely to get a dirty look from them. There miserable and extremely unapproachable especially the man with long hair. Other gyms there is more of a sense of community and friendliness from staff however not this one. || They posted posters everywhere about so called renovations that cost millions of euros and caused disturbance and disruption on entry exit, car park, and facilities for so long. Yet there is no visible improvement at all.  Just this week the car park was flooded. Machines are all rusty and always at least one is broken waiting for service. One specific receptionist is always rude to anyone I witness she has interactions including her colleagues. The only ok thing is the price but seems like they will increase because of the way they keep claiming they are investing on so called improvements… || One of a highlight owned by University College Cork. Adjoining a soccer/rugby ground and a hockey turf pitch. Mardyke is a great center which includes swimming, basketball, gym, badminton, squash , steam , sauna and many more activities. Well equipped and well staffed. Only downside is that it has become overcrowded at the moment and they need to facilitate the new crowd(especially in the gyms). 3 gyms -red, green and blue. 2 sections of steam and sauna.

What makes this place special are the extra services: the possibility to use the sauna and take seaweed baths is a real plus, along with the small bar where you can relax. The surrounding panorama is truly splendid and worth the visit alone.

The value for money is excellent: 25 euros per night is really affordable considering the prices of other campsites in the area. For those looking for an authentic experience, essential services, and great scenery without breaking the bank, this place is perfect.

You can comfortably fit 10 people inside so it's great for a big group. James is incredibly friendly, a great host and makes you feel so welcome, the delicious coffee is a nice bonus too. Great way to relax at the weekend, would recommend to anyone. || The sauna is in the most stunning location looking out on lough corrib. The sauna itself is clean and spacious with fantastic heat and scent from the wood burning stove. Booking in couldn’t be easier. Felt amazing afterwards 10/10. || Best outdoor sauna I’ve been to in Ireland. 🙌

Sits 10-people very, very comfortably. Super spacious and clean.

Top-notch hygiene standards, and the sauna smells great (between the natural wood & essential oils).

Epic views from inside the sauna of both Lough Corrib and of Connemara’s various mountain ranges in the distance.

The location is unmatched. If you like to take a genuine cold-plunge (and not a cold ‘walk-out-into-the-water’) - you can literally step out of the sauna and jump into 8-feet of lake water.

There’s also a ladder (with nice wide steps that don’t hurt your feet) that you can use to plunge in a more ‘controlled’ fashion!

James & The Team are great hosts. Very friendly, very knowledgeable; - and they’ll always have the kettle on for any sauna-goers who fancy a hot drink. || I am blessed to live close to Lough Corrib where Sauna Bhaile pitches up at Kilbeg pier on Sunday mornings - with the possibility of some changes to the time and day for the summer months. James the sauna owner is just the best. He is concerned to provide the optimum experience for his customers and he achieves this. The location is great, the heat generated by the wood burning stove coupled with the use of lovely essential oils is perfect. And James is on hand with free coffee and chats.

I had a go at the pressure therapy along with the Infrared Sauna about two weeks ago and that gave me great results as I was going through the mill with different health problems. It enabled the body to detoxify through the pressure given from the tips of your toes and fingers right through the body. .
This weekend I decided to try the Floatation tank for the first time, what can I say other than I was blown away by the experience. I didn't have great expectations of the treatment, but after this, I will be floating every chance I get. It was the most relaxing thing I have every experienced. You have the feeling of being absorbed in weightlessness in there. The experience was like an induced mindfulness session, I fell asleep and was so refreshed when it finished. I stayed in for the full hour and enjoyed every minute of it.
I thought first I would like the music and lights on, but decided not to. The darkness and quiet was just what I needed.
I couldn't recommend this experience enough to you. if you àre toying with the idea of trying it out, go and do it, you will be pleasantly surprised as was I. 💃💃 || I did a flotation followed by deep tissue massage. It’s just fabulous. Have done this combo a few times now and it is such a treat.  I feel great. Highly recommend this place, the people and the treatments! || Got given a Float session as a gift from my friend. Was apprehensive at first as I'm a bit scared of water! The staff were great and the facilities are immaculate. Took me maybe 5 mins to settle in to the pod and then I was fully relaxed. I put my back out the week before and am stressed at work. My aches and pains floated away and I had the BEST nights sleep that night!
Will definitely go back again!"

I’ll definitely be returning! || I wanted to share my experience because it genuinely made a difference. I had a total knee replacement and worked with Honest Wellness both before and after surgery. Their contrast therapy (alternating hot and cold) helped me manage swelling and stiffness and kept pain surprisingly low.

Before surgery, sessions prepared my body and mind — I felt stronger going in. After surgery, the team tailored each visit to where I was that week. The combination of heat/cold, gentle guidance, and clear home tips meant I was sleeping better, moving sooner, and relying on less pain relief than I expected.

Everyone at Honest Wellness is professional, kind, and genuinely invested in your progress. If you’re facing a knee replacement or rehabbing an injury, I can’t recommend them highly enough. I had very little pain throughout, and I credit a big part of that to their contrast therapy and support."

The sauna itself is spotless, high-end, cosy and welcoming, and you come out feeling completely refreshed. The mix of heat and sea swim is just unbeatable. The staff were so friendly and made the whole visit really relaxed and easy. I’d highly recommend it to anyone visiting Kerry such a treat and something I’ll definitely be back for. || A friend recommended trying the Sauna and sea dip combination a couple of months ago and it is absolutely amazing. The view from the sauna is breathtaking. The owner Maryanne and her daughter are so nice and helpful, guiding us, so as to get the best out of our timeslot. I had never swam in the ocean when the sun wasn't shining, yet the sauna/sea dip combination is something that is enjoyable in sunshine and in the rain. A cold outdoor shower is provided if you don't want a dip in the ocean. Large buckets with lids are provided to store your belongings while you're using the Sauna.
Sauna hats, small towels to sit on and swim shoes are available to use if you forget to bring your own. Watch the time while in the ocean, as your time slot can slip away while enjoying the ocean. Truly amazing. || I visited Fenit Lighthouse Sauna with a group of my friends over the weekend for the first time. We really enjoyed the experience and was only sorry that we didn't go for an hour instead of the half hour slot. The owner Maryanne was so kind and even gave us sliders to go down to the water as we forgot ours.
Would highly recommend! || I booked Fenit Lighthouse Sauna for a recent work event and it was a great success.  MaryAnn was great to deal with, efficient and professional.  The setting is beautiful and I would highly recommend this experience for individuals or groups.  A wonderful experience for all, thank you!"

Place is old and not really well maintained, lockers are tiny and won’t fit everything you might have, showers are filthy with no hair dryer and freezing arctic air around pool area.

Showers: lukewarm roulette wait time 10 min. Lockers a complete joke you hardly can fit one bag into it. Drying area: chaos. Hand dryers mounted like booby traps—kids nearly scalped. Everyone huddled around one socket like it’s the last campfire on Earth.

Only win? The rapid river and wave pool—kids loved it. But honestly, unless you're a penguin or a socket-hunting parent, there's not much to stay for.

The serene surroundings of the vitality suite were so beautiful and calming also. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I think it was a little bit too pricey for Killarney, but that is a management issue and the floor staff in the Spa itself were all amazing!

I was then brought to the vitality area where I could avail of many relaxing and soothing activities including hot beds, ice shower and saunas. I then met Maryanne, an extremely professional therapist who brought me to the treatment room and talked me through everything and asked me was there anything I would like to know. I felt very at ease throughout and had the best massage I have ever received. Afterwards,  I was brought to the relaxation area and given refreshments including a lovely lemon gelato.

We mentioned we’d be driving the Ring of Kerry and might arrive a little late, and he couldn’t have been kinder—he even encouraged us not to miss the stunning Kerry Cliffs before heading over. It turned out to be perfect timing for a sunset soak!
When we arrived, the wooden barrels were already filled with perfectly hot water, ready for us to slip in and relax. We were greeted enthusiastically by Milo, the cutest dog in the world, which made the welcome even more special.
Brendan himself is genuinely one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. We had such great conversation with him—he used to be a tour guide, so he had amazing recommendations for the rest of our trip. His warmth and passion made the whole experience even more memorable.
This was truly an unforgettable experience and an absolute must-do if you’re anywhere near the area. Watching the sun set from a hot seaweed bath, surrounded by Irish scenery and good company, was pure magic! || If I could have one hour of my Wild Atlantic Way trip again, I'd take this one.

Despite it being January, I watched an otter splash around the emptied harbour and a wading egret. Behind them, the rolling mountains, sprinkled with sunspots.

All I had to do was I sit in wooden barrel of warm water with seaweed.

For a whole hour.

It was the best bath I ever had. || This place is honestly a hidden gem— not just for the price & experience, but for Brendan & Milo too! Our group of 4 had such a lovely time lounging in the baths overlooking the estuary, and Brendan was so accommodating when we ended up running behind schedule. In addition to the luxurious seaweed bath, we got to play with Milo who loves to try & catch water splashes. When we were first getting set up, Brendan was so chatty & cheerful asking about our itinerary and plans for our trip, and telling us about the process of collecting and soaking the seaweed. He went out of his way to provide recommended changes to our plans and even drew us a map of how to plan out our time. All of his recommendations were top notch and made our trip that much better. I would make the Sneem Seaweed Baths a habit if they were closer to me, and would definitely recommend anyone traveling to that part of Ireland stop in at least once for a soak! || What a wonderful way to spend an hour; in a seaweed hot tub overlooking beautiful bay and scenery. Invigorated and silky ! Thanks to Brendan for giving us great trip planning advice and Milo for playing with Trevor whilst we bathed ! || I will go back here EVERY time I’m in Ireland!

The sauna was not cleaned between shifts during my experience and it seemed severely overcrowded with people coming and going. This cause the temperature to be lowered and un controlled.

Even timer within sauna was broken. There was no gauge for time.

Views were lovely, and the location was special.

Other than that, I would not recommend."

What to bring:
1. Drinking water and electrolytes to stay hydrated
2. 2 towels: one for the sauna and another to dry yourself after you are done
3. Slippers or beach shoes

To note:
- Leave your valuables in the car because there are no storage boxes
- Make sure you do not need toilets because the nearest are 5 minutes away || I went for an early morning sauna recently and was delighted with the experience. Two clean and HOT saunas.

- proper warm changing rooms

- properly cold plunge pools
- nice hot jacuzzis

Option to have a silent or social sauna when booking. The views are amazing of the river and it’s actually cleaned between sessions which is something I haven’t seen much of in Ireland at other saunas.

They have two saunas - one is a good bit hotter than the other. So you have options to choose from. This can lead to the hotter one being fuller though.

The river being used as the cold plunge is excellent and obviously will never get full - this is a highlight and adds to the uniqueness of this place

Toilets have been added at the back - this is a welcomed addition.

The shared changing rooms are on the smaller side and fill up rather quickly - staggered welcome times might assist with this.

A hot tub was roasting and really enjoyable - a proper treat after the cold plunge on a winters day

They have plenty of seating around a fire pit, cold showers and drop buckets also

A great sauna that I’ll visit again || This is a genuine review.

Really nice setup - cold shower, buckets, swimming area, and a lovely Finnish style sauna 🔥 The only things that let it down is that the toilet is located about 100m away, is locked, and a member of staff has to take you there. The parking situation isn’t great either as there isn’t enough of it, and the carpark is very muddy. However the sauna itself is top notch 👌

Edit: 30/09 after my second visit. Great value at €15 for an hour, and the recent addition of the wood fired hot tub is very nice! The sauna is also very clean. I'd give 4.5 stars if I could - all that's missing is a toilet, because you know, nature calls.

Edit: 23/12, Really nice experience visiting after dark when it's all lit up ✨️ and the fire is going 🔥 Plenty of parking now too, albeit a bit muddy at this time of year. || I had an amazing experience at the sauna sessions nestled deep in the forest. The place is incredibly peaceful and quiet  the only sounds come from the gentle rustling of the trees and the nearby waterfall. The natural surroundings create the perfect atmosphere for relaxation and mindfulness. The sauna itself was cozy, clean, and beautifully designed to blend with nature. The staff are amazing. || A True Return to Nature
I’ve tried many saunas, but nothing compares to the Sauna Sessions at Stradbally experience. The commitment to sustainability isn't just a marketing gimmick—it’s woven into the entire design. Being out in the fresh air, surrounded by the peaceful Stradbally countryside, instantly drops your stress levels before you even step inside. The heat is deep, clean, and perfectly managed by the sauna experts. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Marius for his professionalism and genuine care for the guests. His dedication to making sure we are well taken care of truly makes a difference. You can tell this isn't just a barrel plopped down; this is a meticulously designed space for healing and relaxation. For anyone who cherishes nature and wants a truly conscious wellness experience, this is the only place to go. I felt renewed, recharged, and immediately booked my next session. You will absolutely keep coming back after your first try. || One of the best sauna experiences I've had. The setting is just incredible and the views from the sauna and the hot tub just spectacular.

He chose the ideal location for the cold plunge and even brought water in his van to speed up the filling process. Graham also provided ice blocks.

The sauna was super slick (black in colour) which included essential oils to add to the hot stone. It was also spotless inside, with a footpath before entering. He set up astroturf beneath the steps to the sauna and in front of the cold plunge to zone off the area and enhance the feeling underfoot. We were thrilled with the overall experience they provided and have booked them again. They were incredibly reliable and professional, very friendly to deal with, and I would absolutely recommend them."

I tried to use the shower after in the gym. Was told by one staff member I could and when I came in after using sauna and cold plunge pool, a staff member blocked my way and stood infront of me and told me I couldn’t. Despite the fact I was told I could before, he persisted in saying I couldn’t.

It’s clear they’ve no loyalties towards their regular customers and it’s just about making as much money out of people. What a shame. || Tried to book 4 sessions with my girlfriend, I couldn’t find a way to pay or see if it was pay on arrival, or get in contact with the pages.

I wanted to wait for a while before leaving a review. I’m a big sauna enthusiast, so I was unsure about say the infrared for example, being lower heat. If you, like I was, are looking at purchasing a sauna from here wondering if this is an extravagant purchase that won’t be justified, let me tell you that this sauna is the best thing I own. I use it every day, both my partner and I, sequentially. We run it for 90 minutes, it’s up to heat in about 15 minutes. You are right beside the emitter, so the heat, even though it’s slightly lower than the wood fired sauna, is ample. I cannot do more than 30 straight minutes. And I’ve tried. It has worked flawlessly, takes up less room in my bathroom than the shower base, costs a negligible amount to run, and it makes me happy every time I use it. This business were brilliant in helping me select it, they were really helpful and patient with my questions and requests. I can’t say anything about aftercare because it’s worked flawlessly, but I have confidence they’re a great company.

Here’s my advice, buy the sauna. You won’t regret it. || I had absolutely amazing experience from start to finish with A Room Outside.  Very professional,  helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly  staff with the patience of an angel to answer all my questions, even the silly one.  After consideration of our options, we picked an infrared sauna, which was recommended to us. Delivery was extremely fast, which was an amazing surprise.  Assembly was perfect, with all the explanation of how to use it correctly, too. After one week of daily use of our sauna, I can honestly say that that was the best purchase ever! We both love it! My only regret is to not get one sooner.  I can not recommend Aroomoutside enough! Definitely 10 out of 10!!! || Great store, very friendly staff. Excellent product selection and great value. || I am impressed with the speed of shipping and delivery and the way of contacting the customer. I highly recommend shopping at A ROOM OUTSIDE to everyone who appreciates good customer service (thank you Marie). If all sellers were like them, it would be great. Thank you and best regards to the team. || This is the best BBQ / Braai / Outdoor cooking place I've visited in Ireland. They have a truly wide range and not just a select brand. Everything from Monolith and Kamado Joe to Traeger and Weber and everything in between. Most importantly they have a wide range within each brand and you really can find everything you want a get a glimpse of the stuff you never knew to look for.

More importantly than anything they are genuinely good folk. Knowledgeable, helpful and very nice people. I'll certainly be back  and definitely recommend popping in or going online and picking up some great gear."

We booked the Wild Atlantic Sauna with Mags (25th October 2025) and it was honestly one of the highlights of our entire trip to Donegal. From the moment we arrived, Mags made everything feel so welcoming and personal – you can tell straight away that this isn’t just a business, it’s something she has poured real passion into.

The setting is breathtaking – a cosy barrel sauna tucked into the dunes, looking straight out onto miles of untouched beach, rolling waves, and the Donegal mountains in the distance. Sitting inside the wood-fired heat, watching the Atlantic through the panoramic window, felt like something out of a travel documentary.

The cold-water dip in the sea between sauna rounds was a total buzz – we had a mixture of seasoned dippers and first-timers in our group, and every single person came out beaming. The contrast between the freezing ocean and the crackling fire inside the sauna is addictive, and somehow you come out feeling lighter, calmer, and completely recharged.

What makes it even better is the little thoughtful touches – the relaxing scent of the timber, the bucket and ladle for löyly, the essential oils and Mags’ warm hospitality. Nothing felt rushed, nothing felt commercial – it felt like being hosted by a friend who knows and loves the area.

We had three generations with us – from swimmers in their 20s to a baby wrapped up in a carrier – and everyone got something out of it. It’s the kind of experience that stays with you long after you leave.

If you’re anywhere near Portnoo, Ardara, or Narin, book this. Don’t hesitate. It’s the purest way to experience the Wild Atlantic – sea, heat, salt air, and total switch-off time.

We’ll 100% be back – see your next time mags 😃 || Highly recommended, an incredible experience on the coast of the chilly Atlantic ocean, that offers a welcomed cold dip from the heat of the Finnish sauna with fantastic views of Dooey Beach. We had to visit twice over the course of our week’s holiday. If you are in this part of the world I can’t recommend the sauna enough. Mags the owner is so lovely and responsive, we’ll see you next time. || Gorgeous sauna with a stunning view of Dooey beach. We booked an hour slot in the sauna and had an amazing time. Mags was lovely and recommended a couple of coffee and food spots for afterwards. Will definitely return. || I’d been wanting to try a seaside sauna and this did not disappoint. Highlight of our trip to Dooey beach, would 100% do it again next time we’re there. The views were incredible, and the whole experience so relaxing. Loved trying the essential oils and Mags was so friendly and accommodating. Can’t recommend highly enough! || An absolute gem! Booked for an hour for my mum's 70th birthday and it was fantastic.
Mags is the best host, and the sauna is incredible. The view from the window is breathtaking, the temperature inside was nice and hot, and it's only a few yards to the sea when you need to cool off 🥶!  Mags provided lots of different essential oils, extra wood, and there were a couple of changing rooms so we could dry off out of the wind.
Will definitely be back again when we're in the area, it's unmissable!"

The spot is perfect, the way to go into the lake is easy too and the area is quiet and peaceful. I will go back soon sure!!! Thank you ✨ || What a lovely experience ⭐️ met up with friends at cave town , had lovely walk, picnic, sauna & dip. Would highly recommend the sauna - Mark is so helpful and helps create such a chilled vibe there"

I really can't say enough good things about these guys. Unbelievably helpful every time I contacted them. They have a vast experience & knowledge about saunas & layout design. I would highly recommend Denis, Fiona & all the team. || Had a fault with a Tylo steam generator, was given all the help i needed to fix unit, great to talk to people who know there business and are prepared to help others. Staff were the most polite people ever spoke and went the extra mile to be helpful. || Not sure if the last person's review was of the correct company !!
From my experience they were nothing but a pleasure to deal and could not have being more helpful in every sense of the word. || Extremely unprofessional business. Manager(she) treats employees with no respect. Lack of communication skills from business owner when questioned on products. Will not be returning as a bulk buyer myself. Would not recommend this place to any of my clients. || Excellent service and great products"

The people are so friendly and the sauna is super hot! I couldn’t believe how nice the people were throughout the whole experience! || A fantastic experience and a must do for anyone in the area. Alexi was very hospitable and took care of all our needs. The wood fired sauna and plunge pools were an absolute dream || Such a lovely find. Very friendly and welcoming. Beautiful views over the sea. Great to be able to sea swim and cold plunge. I'll be back! || Had Wild Mourne Wellness down with us today at Oxford Island on the south shore of Lough Neagh to warm around 40 of us up after our NYE dips.
The guys were so easy to work with from booking to all the planning.
A fantastic Sauna that just adds to any event.
If you are planning your own event just give them a shout and they will be able to accommodate you or even visit them in Catlewellan Forest Park.
Thoroughly enjoyed today and can't wait until we do it again.
Thank you to all the team. || Had an absolutely brilliant experience with Wild Mourne Wellness, run by Alexi. The sauna was technically closed when I enquired, but Alexi went out of his way to open it specially for a private session on New Year’s Day, which says everything about the care and passion behind what he’s building.

Given how tough it can be to run sauna businesses in Northern Ireland due to strict council permits, he’s secured a fantastic spot in the beautiful grounds of Castlewellan. Picturesque and perfect for a walk, a dip, or water sports before or after your session.

I really hope Alexi gets the support he needs to upgrade and expand, because this kind of sauna culture deserves to thrive here. If I’m ever back in the area, I’ll absolutely be stopping by again. Wishing him every success."

Its located right at the end of the pier which makes getting into the water very easy (there are steps down to the ocean).. One hour is the perfect length of time - going between the heat of the sauna and the cool refreshing water in the sea! Eli and Claire are very kind and helpful.
